"Warin C,Reinhardt D",Vision: Usable Privacy for XR in the Era of the Metaverse,2022,111–116,5,9781450397001,https://doi.org/10.1145/3549015.3554212,"Extended Reality (XR) — an umbrella term for Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR) — has penetrated the consumer market and is prone to increasingly impact our lives in the near future. Various devices, e.g., MR glasses, AR smartphones apps, or VR headsets, are becoming more affordable, and leader tech companies are heavily investing for a more immersive, realistic, and connected future. Lately, this vision of an interconnected virtual space for people to work, learn, play and share experiences with others has been formulated as the so-called “Metaverse”. This expected paradigm shift will heavily rely on XR, and hence implies an unprecedented amount of sensible data being collected about the users. Indeed, XR devices collect large amounts of sensitive data, including biometric data (e.g., eye gaze and body movement data) that are primarily used as Natural User Interfaces (NUIs) or for the proper functioning of technologies and services. However, research has identified a number of privacy and security threats rooting from this pervasive data collection, as well as privacy threats regarding XR inputs, outputs, user interactions and devices themselves. Still, further efforts must be made to guarantee the privacy and safety of users in a usable fashion in the future, and XR must be considered as a whole rather than as the sum of its parts to match the vision of the Metaverse. In this context, we propose to analyse the gap between user privacy perceptions in XR as a whole, and their concrete behaviour. The goal of this research is to understand the differences and similarities between AR, MR and VR in terms of user privacy perceptions. This will help us to better understand the relationships between XR variants, which, we argue, is an important requirement to approach the future evolution of these technologies, and to consider usable privacy aspects that match the entire XR spectrum. Adopting this vision early on will be beneficial for future work, and will be the foundation for the implementation of a usable privacy-preserving solution in order to raise awareness and empower users by giving them more control over their privacy in the context of these new and future technologies.",

With promises of three-dimensional graphics and interactive interfaces, augmented reality experiences will rival the very best science fiction novels. This breakthrough also brings in unique challenges on how users can authenticate one another to share rich content between augmented reality headsets. Traditional authentication protocols fall short when there is no common central entity or when access to the central authentication server is not available or desirable. Looks Good To Me (LGTM) is an authentication protocol that leverages the unique hardware and context provided with augmented reality headsets to bring innate human trust mechanisms into the digital world to solve authentication in a usable and secure way. LGTM works over point to point wireless communication so users can authenticate one another in a variety of circumstances and is designed with usability at its core, requiring users to perform only two actions: one to initiate and one to confirm. Users intuitively authenticate one another, using seemingly only each other's faces, but under the hood LGTM uses a combination of facial recognition and wireless localization to bootstrap trust from a wireless signal, to a location, to a face, for secure and usable authentication.","usable security, usability, device pairing, augmented reality, wireless localization"

This is largely because they enable a broad range of multi-user applications in which all participants experience the same augmentation of their natural surrounding. However, despite their increasing expansion, there currently exist no implemented methods for secure ad-hoc device pairing of multiple AR headsets. Given the importance of multi-user experiences for future applications of this technology, in this paper we propose two distinct ways to establish secure ad-hoc connections that rely only on typical user interactions in AR: gazing and tapping either at the location of a shared point on the wall or towards the user with whom one wants to connect. To show the feasibility and deployability of the proposed system to existing technology, we build a prototype of Tap-Pair, a system for ad-hoc pairing of AR headsets that is based on Password Authenticated Key Exchange protocols, requires only user interactions that are common in AR, and can be extended to more than two users. The experimental evaluation of the Tap-Pair prototype in a series of measurements at three different locations confirms the feasibility of our proposal, showing that the system built with currently available augmented reality headsets indeed achieves successful pairing in more than 90% of attempts, while keeping the probability of the attacker's success lower than 1e-3.","device pairing, augmented reality, mixed reality, authentication, ar, ar headset, microsoft hololens"

And recently there has been a large shift from handheld-controller dominated interactions to headset-dominated interactions via voice interfaces. In this work, we show a serious privacy risk of using voice interfaces while the user is wearing the face-mounted AR/VR devices. Specifically, we design an eavesdropping attack, Face-Mic, which leverages speech-associated subtle facial dynamics captured by zero-permission motion sensors in AR/VR headsets to infer highly sensitive information from live human speech, including speaker gender, identity, and speech content. Face-Mic is grounded on a key insight that AR/VR headsets are closely mounted on the user's face, allowing a potentially malicious app on the headset to capture underlying facial dynamics as the wearer speaks, including movements of facial muscles and bone-borne vibrations, which encode private biometrics and speech characteristics. To mitigate the impacts of body movements, we develop a signal source separation technique to identify and separate the speech-associated facial dynamics from other types of body movements. We further extract representative features with respect to the two types of facial dynamics. We successfully demonstrate the privacy leakage through AR/VR headsets by deriving the user's gender/identity and extracting speech information via the development of a deep learning-based framework. Extensive experiments using four mainstream VR headsets validate the generalizability, effectiveness, and high accuracy of Face-Mic.","AR/VR headsets, facial dynamics, speech and speaker privacy"

"Khan H,Hengartner U,Vogel D",Mimicry Attacks on Smartphone Keystroke Authentication,2020,,0,,https://doi.org/10.1145/3372420,"Keystroke behaviour-based authentication employs the unique typing behaviour of users to authenticate them. Recent such proposals for virtual keyboards on smartphones employ diverse temporal, contact, and spatial features to achieve over 95% accuracy. Consequently, they have been suggested as a second line of defense with text-based password authentication. We show that a state-of-the-art keystroke behaviour-based authentication scheme is highly vulnerable against mimicry attacks. While previous research used training interfaces to attack physical keyboards, we show that this approach has limited effectiveness against virtual keyboards. This is mainly due to the large number of diverse features that the attacker needs to mimic for virtual keyboards. We address this challenge by developing an augmented reality-based app that resides on the attacker’s smartphone and leverages computer vision and keystroke data to provide real-time guidance during password entry on the victim’s phone. In addition, we propose an audiovisual attack in which the attacker overlays transparent film printed with spatial pointers on the victim’s device and uses audio cues to match the temporal behaviour of the victim. Both attacks require neither tampering or installing software on the victim’s device nor specialized hardware. We conduct experiments with 30 users to mount over 400 mimicry attacks. We show that our methods enable an attacker to mimic keystroke behaviour on virtual keyboards with little effort. We also demonstrate the extensibility of our augmented reality-based technique by successfully mounting mimicry attacks on a swiping behaviour-based continuous authentication system.","behavioural biometrics, Mimicry attacks, authentication, augmented reality, spoofing attacks"

Thus, secure and usable authentication schemes are essential to control access to the HMD and the stored data as well as schemes to authenticate to the services one wants to use with the AR device. We conducted a systematic literature review on knowledge-based authentication schemes for AR HMD. 31 different schemes were identified. These schemes were assessed regarding various aspects including the type of AR HMD, the type of secret, how users input their secret, as well as usability and security aspects.

How to build privacy in virtual reality remains an open question, though it is potentially as important as it is in reality. This paper presents two studies to build privacy in VR with a focus on providing sonic privacy to aid collaborative music making (CMM). The first study uses soundproof walls to provide sonic privacy, the second study applies augmented sound attenuation as a way to produce sonic privacy to aid collaborative music making. Results show privacy is needed and both ways can produce sonic privacy. Privacy provided in the first study is binary and discrete, whilst privacy provided in the latter is continuous, step-less and adjustable. By comparing and discussing between these two approaches, we propose a methodological approach to build privacy to aid collaboration in shared virtual reality. In particular, three channels for building privacy have been identified and three implications have been proposed for designing privacy for collaborative tasks in shared virtual environments, collaborative music making in particular.","Interaction Design, HCI, Audio Attenuation, Virtual Reality Musical Instruments, Virtual Reality, Sonic Interaction, Virtual Environment, Sonic Privacy, Music Computing"

In this context, HMD provide access to sensitive data and applications which demand authenticating users before granting access. Furthermore, these devices are often used in shared spaces. Thus, shoulder-surfing attacks need to be addressed. As users can remember pictures more easily than text, we applied the recognition-based graphical password scheme “Things” from previous work on an AR HMD while placing the pictures for each authentication attempt in a random order. We implemented this scheme for the HMD Microsoft HoloLens and conducted a user study evaluating Things’s usability. All participants could be successfully authenticated and the System Usability Scale (SUS) score is with 74 categorized as above average. We discuss as future work how to improve the SUS scores, e.g., by using different grid designs and input methods.","authentication, graphical passwords, Augmented Reality, Head-Mounted Displays, usability evaluation"

In this work, we pose and explore these questions, identifying means of visual conflict as well as platform design strategies to mediate conflicts. We then analyze state-of-the-art AR platforms (HoloLens, Magic Leap One, and Meta 2) to understand their trade-offs and identify unexplored gaps in the broader design space.

To address this issue, we demonstrate a method for rapidly conducting AR experiments and real-world data collection in the user’s own physical environment using a privacy-conscious mobile web application. The approach leverages the large number of distinct user contexts accessible through crowdsourcing to efficiently source diverse context and perceptual preference data. The insights gathered through this method complement emerging design guidance and sample-limited lab-based studies. The utility of the method is illustrated by re-examining the design challenge of adapting AR text content to the user’s environment.

In this work, we focus on the challenge of output management: how can an AR operating system allow multiple concurrently running applications to safely augment the user's view of the world? That is, how can the OS prevent apps from (for example) interfering with content displayed by other apps or the user's perception of critical real-world context, while still allowing them sufficient flexibility to implement rich, immersive AR scenarios?

This requisite sensing also opens the door for more advanced AR-driven activities, such as augmented perception, volumetric capture and biometric identification - activities with the potential to expose bystanders to significant privacy risks. Existing Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) often safeguard against these risks at a low level e.g., instituting camera access controls. However, we argue that such PETs are incompatible with the need for always-on sensing given AR headsets' intended everyday use. Through an online survey (N=102), we examine bystanders' awareness of, and concerns regarding, potentially privacy infringing AR activities; the extent to which bystanders' consent should be sought; and the level of granularity of information necessary to provide awareness of AR activities to bystanders. Our findings suggest that PETs should take into account the AR activity type, and relationship to bystanders, selectively facilitating awareness and consent. In this way, we can ensure bystanders feel their privacy is respected by everyday AR headsets, and avoid unnecessary rejection of these powerful devices by society.","Biometrics, Privacy, Extended Perception, Augmented Reality, Altered Reality, Bystanders"

We achieve a balanced accuracy score of 92.675% and an EER of 11% using an Adaptive Boost Random Forest classifier together with our proposed series of novel, AR-specific preprocessing methods used on our current dataset. This demonstrates that it is indeed possible to profile and authenticate AR head-mounted display users based on their head movements and gestures.","mixed-reality biometric authentication, AR authentication, gesture-based biometric authentication"

This rise in popularity is thanks in part to the functionalities offered by commercially available vision libraries such as ARCore, Vuforia, and Google’s ML Kit; however, these libraries also give rise to the possibility of a hidden operations threat, that is, the ability of a malicious or incompetent application developer to conduct additional vision operations behind the scenes of an otherwise honest AR application without alerting the end-user. In this article, we present the privacy risks associated with the hidden operations threat and propose a framework for application development and runtime permissions targeted specifically at preventing the execution of hidden operations. We follow this with a set of experimental results, exploring the feasibility and utility of our system in differentiating between user-expectation-compliant and non-compliant AR applications during runtime testing, for which preliminary results demonstrate accuracy of up to 71%.

Established concepts (e.g., 2D authentication schemes) are vulnerable to observation attacks, and most alternatives are relatively slow. We present RubikAuth, an authentication scheme for VR where users authenticate quickly and secure by selecting digits from a virtual 3D cube that leverages coordinated 3D manipulation and pointing. We report on results from three studies comparing how pointing using eye gaze, head pose, and controller tapping impact RubikAuth’s usability, memorability, and observation resistance under three realistic threat models. We found that entering a four-symbol RubikAuth password is fast: 1.69–3.5 s using controller tapping, 2.35–4.68 s using head pose and 2.39 –4.92 s using eye gaze, and highly resilient to observations: 96–99.55% of observation attacks were unsuccessful. RubikAuth also has a large theoretical password space: 45n for an n-symbols password. Our work underlines the importance of considering novel but realistic threat models beyond standard one-time attacks to fully assess the observation-resistance of authentication schemes.

Now, with the increasing user adoption of augmented, mixed, and virtual reality (AR/MR/VR; we collectively refer to as MR) technology on user mobile devices, spatial data has become more ubiquitous. However, this ubiquity also opens up a new threat vector for adversaries: aside from the traditional forms of mobile media such as images and video, spatial data poses additional and, potentially, latent risks to users of AR/MR/VR. Thus, in this work, we analyse MR spatial data using various spatial complexity metrics---including a cosine similarity-based, and a Euclidean distance-based metric---as heuristic or empirical measures that can signify the inference risk a captured space has. To demonstrate the risk, we utilise 3D shape recognition and classification algorithms for spatial inference attacks over various 3D spatial data captured using mobile MR platforms: i.e. Microsoft HoloLens, and Android with Google ARCore. Our experimental evaluation and investigation shows that the cosine similarity-based metric is a good spatial complexity measure of captured 3D spatial maps and can be utilised as an indicator of spatial inference risk.","object detection, privacy, and resource sharing, mixed or augmented reality"

In this paper, we conducted a human-subject study to understand the impact of accuracy, precision, latency, and dropout based errors on users’ performance when using shared gaze cues to identify a target among a crowd of people. We simulated varying amounts of errors and the target distances and measured participants’ objective performance through their response time and error rate, and their subjective experience and cognitive load through questionnaires.

We explore four types of cues (interactive, communication-based, ambient, and infrastructure) and their impact on how collaborators hide and share blended physical-virtual documents. Many participants did not obviously develop a sense that the physical and virtual surroundings were fused; as a result, certain physical privacy behaviours (e.g., orienting one's body to shield documents from the remote collaborator) were less apparent in the study.

Since there have been few acceptance studies in the field of AR, it was particularly important to identify the factors that affect user acceptance of AR technology. Technology acceptance studies typically predict behavioral adoption by investigating the relationship between attitudes and intentions, even though intention may not be the best predictor of actual behavior. Personality constructs and dimensions of cultural difference have recently been found to explain even more variance in behavior and provide insights into user behavior. The objective of this study is to identify the personality traits that affect users' acceptance of CybAR and increase their cybersecurity awareness.

With these permissions granted, any Internet-enabled AR app could silently collect camera frames and derived visual information for malicious intent without a user's awareness. This raises serious concerns about the disclosure of private user data in their living environments.To give users more control over application usage of their camera frames and the information derived from them, we introduce LensCap, a split-process app design framework, in which the app is split into a camera-handling visual process and a connectivity-handling network process. At runtime, LensCap manages secured communications between split processes, enacting fine-grained data usage monitoring. LensCap also allows both processes to present interactive user interfaces. With LensCap, users can decide what forms of visual data can be transmitted to the network, while still allowing visual data to be used for AR purposes on device.

Current solutions for privacy management are severely lacking as they are ineffective in making users aware of potential privacy risks or how to mitigate them and as they offer limited support for interaction. As our first contribution, we develop a novel AR privacy management interface (PARA) that uses AR visualization to contextualize data disclosure and improve user’s perceptions of privacy threats. Besides offering support for enhancing user’s privacy perceptions, our interface supports privacy control on compatible devices through privacy-enhancing technologies. As our second contribution, we systematically study factors affecting privacy perceptions and privacy control for two device classes (smart camera and smart speaker) through a user study with N = 32 participants. Our results show that PARA’s contextualization and visualization of privacy disclosure strongly affect the participants’ privacy perceptions. For privacy control, we demonstrate that our prototype improves the participant’s capability to identify risks and provides an effective and easy-to-use mechanism for controlling privacy disclosure, in contrast to existing state-of-the-art privacy management interfaces.","augmented reality, AR-IoT interaction., graphical user interfaces, control, management, mixed reality, smart devices, privacy"

We present a simple yet effective privacy attack that extracts sensitive scene information such as human faces and text from rendered objects under several application scenarios.To defend against such attacks, we develop a novel IPC2S defense and a conditional R2 defense.

As a proof-of-concept, we leverage existing OCR and face detection models to identify text and human faces from past camera observations and blur the color pixels associated with detected regions. We evaluate the visual quality impact of our defense by comparing rendered virtual objects to ones rendered with a generic multi-lighting reconstruction technique, ARKit, and R2 defense.

"Lesi V,Jovanov I,Pajic M",Integrating Security in Resource-Constrained Cyber-Physical Systems,2020,,0,,https://doi.org/10.1145/3380866,"Defense mechanisms against network-level attacks are commonly based on the use of cryptographic techniques, such as lengthy message authentication codes (MAC) that provide data integrity guarantees. However, such mechanisms require significant resources (both computational and network bandwidth), which prevents their continuous use in resource-constrained cyber-physical systems (CPS). Recently, it was shown how physical properties of controlled systems can be exploited to relax these stringent requirements for systems where sensor measurements and actuator commands are transmitted over a potentially compromised network; specifically, that merely intermittent use of data authentication (i.e., at occasional time points during system execution), can still provide strong Quality-of-Control (QoC) guarantees even in the presence of false-data injection attacks, such as Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. Consequently, in this work, we focus on integrating security into existing resource-constrained CPS, in order to protect against MitM attacks on a system where a set of control tasks communicates over a real-time network with system sensors and actuators. We introduce a design-time methodology that incorporates requirements for QoC in the presence of attacks into end-to-end timing constraints for real-time control transactions, which include data acquisition and authentication, real-time network messages, and control tasks. This allows us to formulate a mixed integer linear programming-based method for direct synthesis of schedulable tasks and message parameters (i.e., deadlines and offsets) that do not violate timing requirements for the already deployed controllers, while adding a sufficient level of protection against network-based attacks; specifically, the synthesis method also provides suitable intermittent authentication policies that ensure the desired QoC levels under attack. To additionally reduce the security-related bandwidth overhead, we propose the use of cumulative message authentication at time instances when the integrity of messages from subsets of sensors should be ensured. Furthermore, we introduce a method for the opportunistic use of the remaining resources to further improve the overall QoC guarantees while ensuring system (i.e., task and message) schedulability. Finally, we demonstrate applicability and scalability of our methodology on synthetic automotive systems as well as a real-world automotive case-study.","quality-of-control, Cyber-physical systems security, real-time scheduling, mixed integer linear programming"

How to authenticate users operating on these devices is thus an important problem. IoT devices usually lack conventional user interfaces, such as keyboards and mice, which makes traditional authentication methods inapplicable. We present a virtual sensing technique that allows IoT devices to virtually sense user 'petting' (in the form of some very simple touches for about 2 seconds) on the devices. Based on this technique, we build a secure and intuitive authentication method that authenticates device users by comparing the petting operations sensed by devices and those captured by the user wristband. The authentication method is highly secure as physical operations are required, rather than based on proximity. It is also intuitive, adopting very simple authentication operations, e.g., clicking buttons, twisting rotary knobs, and swiping touchscreens. Unlike the state-of-the-art methods, our method does not require any hardware modifications of devices, and thus can be applied to commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices. We build prototypes and evaluate them comprehensively, demonstrating their high effectiveness, security, usability, and efficiency.","authentication, virtual sensing, internet of things"

In this 'gold rush', applications are being developed quickly and, in turn, not being developed with security in mind.This paper investigated a selection of VPN applications available on the Apple App Store (for iOS devices) and tested the applications for security and privacy issues. This includes testing for any traffic being transmitted over plain HTTP, DNS leakage and transmission of personally identifiable information (such as phone number, International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), email address, MAC address) and evaluating the security of the tunneling protocol used by the VPN.The testing methodology involved installing VPN applications on a test device, simulating network traffic for a pre-defined period of time and capturing the traffic. This allows for all traffic to be analysed to check for anything being sent without encryption. Other issues that often cause de-anonymization with VPN applications such as DNS leakage were also considered.The research found several common security issues with VPN applications tested, with a large majority of applications still using HTTP and not HTTPS for transmitting certain data. A large majority of the VPN applications failed to route additional user data (such as DNS queries) through the VPN tunnel. Furthermore, just fifteen of the tested applications were found to have correctly implemented the best-recommended tunneling protocol for user security.Outside of the regular testing criteria, other security anomalies were observed with specific applications, which included outdated servers with known vulnerabilities, applications giving themselves the ability to perform HTTPS interception and questionable privacy policies.From the documented vulnerabilities, this research proposes a set of recommendations for developers to consider when developing VPN applications.","VPN, virtual private network, iOS, mobile, privacy, security"

The concept of Virtual Proof of Reality (VPoR) proposed by Rührmair et al. in 2015 has come up with a Sense-Prove-Validate framework for integrity checking of abundant data generated from billions of connected sensors. It leverages the unreliability factor of Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) with respect to ambient parameter variations such as temperature, supply voltages, and so on, and claims to prove the authenticity of the sensor data without using any explicit keys. The state-of-the-art authenticated sensing protocols majorly lack in limited authentications and huge storage overhead. These protocols also assume that the behaviour of the PUF instances varies unpredictably for different levels of ambient factors, which in turn makes them hard to go beyond the theoretical concept. We address these issues in this work1 and propose a Machine Learning (ML) assisted PUF calibration scheme to predict the Challenge-Response Pair (CRP) behaviour of a PUF instance in a specific environment, given the CRP behaviour in a pivot environment. Here, we present a new class of authenticated sensing protocols where we leverage the beneficence of ML techniques to validate the authenticity and integrity of sensor data over ambient factor variations. The scheme also reduces the storage complexity of the verifier from O(p * K * l * (c + r)) to O(p * l *(c + r)), where p is the number of PUF instances deployed in the framework, l is the number of challenge-response pairs used for authentication, c is the bit lengths of the challenge, r is the response bits of the PUF, and K is the number of levels of ambient factor variations. The scheme alleviates the issue of limited authentication as well, whereby every CRP is used only once for authentication and then deleted from the database. To validate the proposed protocol through actual experiments on FPGA, we propose 5-4 Double Arbiter PUF, which is an extension of Double Arbiter PUFs (DAPUFs) as this design is more suited for FPGA, and implement it on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGAs. We characterise the proposed PUF instance from −20°C to 80°C and use Random Forest--based ML technique to generate a soft model of the PUF instance. This model is further used by the verifier to authenticate the actual PUF circuit. According to the FPGA-based validation, the proposed protocol with DAPUF can be effectively used to authenticate sensor devices across wide variations of temperature values.","double arbiter PUFs, FPGA, Authenticated sensing, reliability, virtual proofs (VPs), physically unclonable functions (PUFs)"

Standard methods for this type of attacks rely on the use of cryptographic mechanisms, such as Message Authentication Codes (MACs) to ensure data integrity. However, this approach incurs significant computation overhead, limiting its use in resource constrained systems. Consequently, we consider the problem of scheduling multiple control tasks on a shared processor while providing a suitable level of security guarantees. Specifically, by security guarantees we refer to control performance, i.e., Quality-of-Control (QoC), in the presence of attacks. We start by mapping requirements for QoC under attack into constraints for security-aware control tasks that, besides standard control operations, intermittently perform data authentication. This allows for the analysis of the impact that security-related computation overhead has on both schedulability of control tasks and QoC. Building on this analysis, we introduce a mixed-integer linear programming-based technique to obtain a schedulable task set with predefined QoC requirements. Also, to facilitate optimal resource allocation, we provide a method to analyze interplay between available computational resources and the overall QoC under attack, and show how to obtain a schedulable task set that maximizes the overall QoC guarantees. Finally, we prove usability of our approach on a case study with multiple automotive control components.","CPS security, real-time scheduling, mixed integer linear programming, quality-of-control"

Results suggest that individuals do care about the dangers associated with having one's privacy violated by an IoT device and are more willing to engage in protective measures if they believe they are able to understand the various mechanisms for doing so, but only if the costs are not too high.

Coupled with automated real-time analytics, these capabilities can be leveraged to enable such networks to automatically detect security threats in real-time, dynamically reconfigure themselves to protect against these threats, and automatically immunize themselves against evolving threats. We present an approach that combines real-time analytics with autonomics -- using anomaly detection to identify potential security threats, in combination with autonomics to enable dynamic network reconfigurations to mitigate against these threats. A key challenge is to distinguish good anomalies arising from legitimate increases in network traffic, for example due to natural disasters, flash mobs, or other unexpected events, from bad anomalies arising from potential security attacks, as the autonomic actions may widely vary: e.g., dynamic increase of network resources for increases in legitimate traffic, instantiation of virtual security functions in the face of security attacks. We present a combination of machine learning based detection with temporal logic based analysis that provides a foundation for distinguishing these anomalies and enabling dynamic network autonomics in response. We illustrate our approach through a case study on distributed denial of service attacks on SIP-based virtualized networks.","Analytics, Machine learning, Autonomics, Temporal logic, State-based analysis, Security, Virtual networks, SIP, Runtime verification"

Already today, mobile and wearable devices allow people to create rich logs of their daily experiences in the form of photos, videos, GPS traces, or even physiological data. This activity is often called lifelogging, and has led to the so-called quantified self movement where people capture detailed traces of their everyday lives in order to better understand themselves. An interesting avenue to explore in this context is the possibility of capturing lifelog data for the sake of augmenting one's memory. Contemporary psychology theory suggests that captured experiences of daily events can be used to generate cues (hints) which, when reviewed, can improve subsequent long-term recall of these memories. However, limitations of on-body placement of wearable devices can yield poor quality data and restricts capture to a first-person perspective. The focus of this work is to enable the secure and automatic exchange of one's lifelog streams with both co-located peers and any available capture devices in an IoT infrastructure, in order to construct a more comprehensive representation of a previous experience, which can thus help one to create more effective cues.

Indeed, such work has produced highly effective, low-overhead defenses that are now commonly deployed in many systems today. One application space that has seen comparatively little focus is that of safety- and mission-critical systems, which are often real-time systems (RTS) with temporal requirements. Furthermore, such systems are increasingly being targeted by attackers, such as in industrial control systems (ICS), including power grids. The strict timing requirements of these systems presents a different design objective than is common in general-purpose applications -- systems should be designed around the worst-case performance, rather than the average case. Perhaps in part due to these alternative design considerations, many real-time systems have not benefited from much of the work on software security that common general-purpose and enterprise applications have, despite the ubiquity of real-time systems that actively control so many applications we as a society have come to rely on, from power generation and distribution, to automotive and avionic applications, and many others.This paper explores the application of moving-target defenses in the context of real-time systems. In particular, the worst-case performance of several address-space randomization defenses are evaluated to study the implications of such designs in real-time applications. These results suggest that current moving-target defenses, while performant in the average case, can exhibit significant tail latencies, which can be problematic in real-time applications, especially if such overheads are not considered in the design and analysis of the system. These results inform future research directions for moving-target defenses in real-time applications.","security, real-time, moving-target defenses, moving target defenses, cyber"

User modeling has long been a fundamental task with the goal of capturing the latent characteristics of users from their behaviors. However, centralized user modeling on collected data has raised concerns about the risk of data misuse and privacy leakage. As a result, federated user modeling has come into favor, since it expects to provide secure multi-client collaboration for user modeling through federated learning. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, existing federated learning methods that ignore the inconsistency among clients cannot be applied directly to practical user modeling scenarios, and moreover, they meet the following critical challenges: 1) Statistical heterogeneity. The distributions of user data in different clients are not always independently identically distributed (IID), which leads to unique clients with needful personalized information; 2) Privacy heterogeneity. User data contains both public and private information, which have different levels of privacy, indicating that we should balance different information shared and protected; 3) Model heterogeneity. The local user models trained with client records are heterogeneous, and thus require a flexible aggregation in the server; 4) Quality heterogeneity. Low-quality information from inconsistent clients poisons the reliability of user models and offsets the benefit from high-quality ones, meaning that we should augment the high-quality information during the process. To address the challenges, in this paper, we first propose a novel client-server architecture framework, namely Hierarchical Personalized Federated Learning (HPFL), with a primary goal of serving federated learning for user modeling in inconsistent clients. More specifically, the client train and deliver the local user model via the hierarchical components containing hierarchical information from privacy heterogeneity to join collaboration in federated learning. Moreover, the client updates the personalized user model with a fine-grained personalized update strategy for statistical heterogeneity. Correspondingly, the server flexibly aggregates hierarchical components from heterogeneous user models in the case of privacy and model heterogeneity with a differentiated component aggregation strategy. In order to augment high-quality information and generate high-quality user models, we expand HPFL to the Augmented-HPFL (AHPFL) framework by incorporating the augmented mechanisms, which filters out low-quality information such as noise, sparse information and redundant information. Specially, we construct two implementations of AHPFL, i.e., AHPFL-SVD and AHPFL-AE, where the augmented mechanisms follow SVD (singular value decomposition) and AE (autoencoder), respectively. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of both HPFL and AHPFL frameworks.","Model personalization, Augmented mechanism, User modeling, Federated learning, Privacy heterogeneity"

However, while these architectures offer strong confidentiality and integrity guarantees for software modules, they offer no availability (let alone real-time) guarantees. This paper reports on our work-in-progress towards extending a protected module architecture for small microprocessors with availability and real-time guarantees. Our objective is to maintain the existing security guarantees with a hardware-only TCB, but to also guarantee availability (and even real-time properties) if one can also trust the scheduler. The scheduler, as any software on the platform, remains untrusted for confidentiality and integrity -- but it is sufficient to trust the scheduler module to get availability guarantees even on a partially compromised platform.","trusted computing, Protected module architecture, mixed-criticality, real-time operating system, secure interrupt, secure scheduling"

As these edge devices are in proximity to users, this results in improved application response times and reduces load on the cloud data center (cdc). In this paper, we propose a security and deadline aware scheduling algorithm called RT-SANE (Real-Time Security Aware scheduling on the Network Edge). Applications with stringent privacy requirements are scheduled on an mdc closer to the user, whereas others can be scheduled on a cdc or a remote mdc. We also discuss how application performance and network latency influence the choice of an mdc or cdc. The intuition is that due to a lower communication latency between the user & the mdc, more applications are able to meet their deadlines when run on the mdc. Conversely, applications with loose deadlines may be executed on a cdc. In order to facilitate this, we also propose a distributed orchestration architecture and protocol that is both performance & security aware. Simulation results show that RTSANE offers superior real-time performance compared to a number of other scheduling policies in an Edge computing environment, while meeting application privacy requirements.","iot, distributed orchestration, security., cloud data center, edge computing, micro data centers, cloudlets, internet of things, fog computing, real-time, cloud computing"

Fog computing, located as close as possible to data sources at the edge of IoT systems, deals with this problem. Some IoT data are sensitive and require privacy controls. The proposed Policy Enforcement Fog Module (PEFM), running within a single fog, operates close to data sources connected to their fog, and enforces privacy policies for all sensitive IoT data generated by these data sources. PEFM distinguishes two kinds of fog data processing. First, fog nodes process data for local IoT applications, running within the local fog. All real-time data processing must be local to satisfy real-time constraints. Second, fog nodes disseminate data to nodes beyond the local fog (including remote fogs and clouds) for remote (and non-real-time) IoT applications. PEFM has two components for these two kinds of fog data processing. First, Local Policy Enforcement Module (LPEM), performs direct privacy policy enforcement for sensitive data accessed by local IoT applications. Second, Remote Policy Enforcement Module (RPEM), sets up a mechanism for indirectly enforcing privacy policies for sensitive data sent to remote IoT applications. RPEM is based on creating and disseminating Active Data Bundles-software constructs bundling inseparably sensitive data, their privacy policies, and an execution engine able to enforce privacy policies. To prove effectiveness and efficiency of the solution, we developed a proof-of-concept scenario for a smart home IoT application. We investigate privacy threats for sensitive IoT data and show a framework for using PEFM to overcome these threats.","cloud computing, fog computing, internet of things, sensitive data, smart home, privacy, real-time processing, active data bundles"

SODA 2019; Cheu et al. EUROCRYPT 2019) and its close relative encode-shuffle-analyze (Bittau et al. SOSP 2017) provide a fertile middle ground between the well-known local and central models. Similarly to the local model, the shuffle model assumes an untrusted data collector who receives privatized messages from users, but in this case a secure shuffler is used to transmit messages from users to the collector in a way that hides which messages came from which user. An interesting feature of the shuffle model is that increasing the amount of messages sent by each user can lead to protocols with accuracies comparable to the ones achievable in the central model. In particular, for the problem of privately computing the sum of n bounded real values held by n different users, Cheu et al. showed that O(sqrtn ) messages per user suffice to achieve O(1) error (the optimal rate in the central model), while Balle et al. (CRYPTO 2019) recently showed that a single message per user leads to Theta(n^1/3 ) MSE (mean squared error), a rate strictly in-between what is achievable in the local and central models. This paper introduces two new protocols for summation in the shuffle model with improved accuracy and communication trade-offs. Our first contribution is a recursive construction based on the protocol from Balle et al. mentioned above, providing poly(log log n) error with O(log log n) messages per user. The second contribution is a protocol with O(1) error and O(1) messages per user based on a novel analysis of the reduction from secure summation to shuffling introduced by Ishai et al. (FOCS 2006) (the original reduction required O(log n) messages per user). We also provide a numerical evaluation showing that our protocols provide good trade-offs between privacy, accuracy and communication for realistic values of n.","differential privacy, secure summation, shuffle model, real summation"

Currently, a widely-used surgical risk calculator online web system developed by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) uses patients’ static features, e.g. gender, age, to assess the risk of postoperative complications. However, the most crucial signals that reflect the actual postoperative physical conditions of patients are usually real-time dynamic signals, including the vital signs of patients (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure) collected from postoperative monitoring. In this paper, we develop a dynamic postoperative complication risk scoring framework (DyCRS) to detect the “at-risk” patients in a real-time way based on postoperative sequential vital signs and static features. DyCRS is based on adaptations of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that captures hidden states as well as observable states to generate a real-time, probabilistic, complication risk score. Evaluating our model using electronic health record (EHR) on elective Colectomy surgery from a major health system, we show that DyCRS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art ACS calculator and real-time predictors with 50.16% area under precision-recall curve (AUCPRC) gain on average in terms of detection effectiveness. In terms of earliness, our DyCRS can predict 15hrs55mins earlier on average than clinician’s diagnosis with the recall of 60% and precision of 55%. Furthermore, Our DyCRS can extract interpretable patients’ stages, which are consistent with previous medical postoperative complication studies. We believe that our contributions demonstrate significant promise for developing a more accurate, robust and interpretable postoperative complication risk scoring system, which can benefit more than 50 million annual surgeries in the US by substantially lowering adverse events and healthcare costs.","Interpretability, Hidden Markov Model, Real-time risk score, Postoperative complications"

This article studies the impact of integrity attacks on real-time pricing (RTP), an emerging feature of advanced power grids that can improve system efficiency. Recent studies have shown that RTP creates a closed loop formed by the mutually dependent real-time price signals and price-taking demand. Such a closed loop can be exploited by an adversary whose objective is to destabilize the pricing system. Specifically, small malicious modifications to the price signals can be iteratively amplified by the closed loop, causing highly volatile prices, fluctuating power demand, and increased system operating cost. This article adopts a control-theoretic approach to deriving the fundamental conditions of RTP stability under basic demand, supply, and RTP models that characterize the essential behaviors of consumers, suppliers, and system operators, as well as two broad classes of integrity attacks, namely, the scaling and delay attacks. We show that, under an approximated linear time-invariant formulation, the RTP system is at risk of being destabilized only if the adversary can compromise the price signals advertised to consumers, by either reducing their values in the scaling attack or providing old prices to over half of all consumers in the delay attack. The results provide useful guidelines for system operators to analyze the impact of various attack parameters on system stability so that they may take adequate measures to secure RTP systems.","smart grid, real-time pricing, stability, cyber security, electricity market, Power grid, demand response"

While the vast majority of existing works focus on attack prevention and detection, the key question is “what to do after detecting an attack?”. This problem attracts fairly rare attention though its significance is emphasized by the need to mitigate or even eliminate attack impacts on a system. In this article, we study this attack response problem and propose novel real-time recovery for securing CPS. First, this work’s core component is a recovery control calculator using a Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with timing and safety constraints. This component can smoothly steer back a physical system under control to a target state set before a safe deadline and maintain the system state in the set once it is driven to it. We further propose an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm that can fast solve the LQR-based recovery problem. Second, supporting components for the attack recovery computation include a checkpointer, a state reconstructor, and a deadline estimator. To realize these components respectively, we propose (i) a sliding-window-based checkpointing protocol that governs sufficient trustworthy data, (ii) a state reconstruction approach that uses the checkpointed data to estimate the current system state, and (iii) a reachability-based approach to conservatively estimate a safe deadline. Finally, we implement our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in dealing with totally 15 experimental scenarios which are designed based on 5 CPS simulators and 3 types of sensor attacks.","security, real-time, sensor attack, Cyber-physical system, linear-quadratic regulator, recovery"

However, using X-ray images during security inspections is challenging because the X-ray image containing prohibited items (positive samples) in the real-world security inspection scenario is much smaller than those that do not contain prohibited items (negative samples). This results in low detection efficiency of the auto security inspection and many false detections. Considering this problem, this paper proposes detecting and recognizing prohibited items on X-ray images in real-world security inspections based on multi-task learning (MTL). This method uses an image classification network to filter out most X-ray images that do not contain prohibited items, thus reducing false detections and improving detection efficiency. MTL simultaneously trains the image classification network and the detection network of prohibited items. In addition, the backbone of the MTL network adopts a model sharing method that can reduce model parameters and improve the convergence speed of the model. Based on a dataset of security inspection X-ray images where the ratio of negative samples to positive samples is 100 (SIXray100), we performed data augmentation, estimated the target anchor of the training set, and used the concept of multi-scale training to complete the model training. Compared with the class-balanced hierarchical refinement method (CHR) that proposed a benchmark in detection, our method shows an improvement of 2% to 5%. Moreover, as the number of test images increases, our approach will obtain results that significantly exceed those from previous research. At the same time, this paper’s strategy for detecting prohibited items and its shared neural network framework have significant application value in engineering.","X-ray images, Prohibited items detection, Real-world security inspection scenario, Multi-task learning"

While it enables cost-effective resource sharing, it increases security risks for the hosted applications. Indeed, multiplexing virtual resources belonging to different tenants on the same physical substrate may lead to critical security concerns such as cross-tenants data leakage and denial of service. Particularly, virtual networks isolation failures are among the foremost security concerns in the cloud. To remedy these, automated tools are needed to verify security mechanisms compliance with relevant security policies and standards. However, auditing virtual networks isolation is challenging due to the dynamic and layered nature of the cloud. Particularly, inconsistencies in network isolation mechanisms across cloud-stack layers, namely, the infrastructure management and the implementation layers, may lead to virtual networks isolation breaches that are undetectable at a single layer. In this article, we propose an offline automated framework for auditing consistent isolation between virtual networks in OpenStack-managed cloud spanning over overlay and layer 2 by considering both cloud layers’ views. To capture the semantics of the audited data and its relation to consistent isolation requirement, we devise a multi-layered model for data related to each cloud-stack layer’s view. Furthermore, we integrate our auditing system into OpenStack, and present our experimental results on assessing several properties related to virtual network isolation and consistency.

The current research examines whether network ties, which are an aspect of structural social capital that can be categorized into strong and weak social ties, can provide a non-trivial explanation for members? trust, reciprocity, and identification in a virtual community for website programming interest. This relationship enables us to examine a context in which members share a common goal of resolving programming problems through knowledge sharing in contrast with other community settings where only general topics are discussed (e.g., societal and emotional issues). Data were collected through a survey of a virtual community for website programming composed of 69 members. Affirming conventional perception, results of the study indicate that weak ties affect the level of generalized trust and facilitate group identification. Remarkably, the number of members? strong ties is not significantly related to the degree of their perceived norms regarding generalized reciprocity. Reciprocity refers to a mutual expectation that a benefit granted at present should be repaid in the future. The results suggest two key points. First, even for a virtual community of interest, weak ties overshadow strong ties in explaining the outcome variables. Second, reciprocity is not guaranteed even in a focused form of discussion with a non-social topic that involves specialized knowledge. Therefore, virtual community members should be cautious even if ties are strong. Overall, results imply that virtual community administrators, particularly those who manage specialized communities, should be attentive to the strong and weak ties that exist among the community members.","identification, social ties, virtual community, reciprocity, trust"

However, it is challenging for identifying the complex feature-influence from construction environments and building characteristics. It is also hard to alleviate the heterogeneity of real estate. In this article, we propose a framework named Adaptive Weighted Finite Mixture Model to identify the feature-influence and simultaneously alleviate the ill effect of heterogeneity. Applying this framework, we can predict the housing unit price based on the corresponding features. Besides, we discover that the feature-influence exists in the dissimilarity among similar cities. Specifically, we adaptively learn the weights of features to identify the feature-influence, and we model the estimation of the housing unit price with the feature-influence into a finite mixture model. We utilize the Principle Component Analysis algorithm to obtain a low-dimensional representation of housing features. The low-dimensional representation reduces the computational cost of model learning, and it avoids a potential catastrophe of the singular matrix inversion during the process of learning model parameters, which are estimated by the Expectation Maximization algorithm. To avoid the blind search for the latent group number used in the proposed framework, we employ the pre-clustering result as a guide of the searching range of the latent group numbers. We conduct numerous experiments on three real datasets from Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin, which are the three provincial capital cities that have similar geography, economics, and cultures.

We found that the majority of cases occurred in (semi-)public spaces during afternoon and evening times, when users left their items. From these results, we derived a model of incidents involving personal items in public space as well as a set of properties to describe situations where personal items may be at risk.

VRs route traffic between network segments and support network services. Routers, including VRs, have been the target of several recent high-profile attacks, emphasizing the need for more security measures, including security monitoring. However, existing agent-based monitoring systems are incompatible with a VR's temporary nature, stripped-down operating system, and placement in the cloud. As a result, VRs are often not monitored, leading to undetected security incidents.This paper proposes a new security monitoring design that leverages virtualization instead of in-guest agents. Its hypervisor-based system, Arav, scrutinizes VRs by novel application of Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) breakpoint injection. Arav monitored and addressed security-related events in two common VRs, pfSense and VyOS, and detected four attacks against two popular VR services, Quagga and OpenVPN. Arav's performance overhead is negligible, less than 0.63%, demonstrating VMI's utility in monitoring virtual machines unsuitable for traditional security monitoring.","cloud security, virtual routers, virtual machine introspection"

The previous works on the subject of virtualization security have some limitations: either we can not implement them, no performance evaluation or it increases the workload at servers or haven't quantitative analysis.This paper proposes a new approach to minimize Virtual machine escape attack in which the attacker's goal is to co-locate their VMs with the targets VMs on the same physical server. In order to proliferate his attack on the virtual machines of other users on the same hypervisor.Hence, we model different basic VM allocation policies using a game theoretic approach to get quantitative analysis. In each VM allocation policies, attacker's action is to decide when to start the VMs, how many VMs to start, what is the security level of its VMs. The goal of the defender will be to find a VM allocation policy that minimizes attacker's possibility. We also presented the attack efficiency, cost, coverage, power consumption and workload balance under the VM allocation policies and compute the numerical solution in CloudSim. This solution does not require any changes to the underlying infrastructure. Our results show that the Round Robin policy is the least secure allocation policy against Virtual machine escape attack. In order to minimise the efficiency rates for the attacker, the cloud provider should use a probabilistic VM allocation policy.","Cloud Computing, Virtualization, Game Theory, Security"

However, it is not known how self-similar avatars support creative idea generation. We propose that self-similarity supports the generation of original ideas, because it (i) increases the identification a user has with its avatar, which (ii) increases positive affect, and (iii) influences the positive affect-original idea generation link. To test this conjecture, an experiment was conducted where people composed their own avatar to be either self-similar or non-self-similar, which they then used to engage in two idea generation tasks presented within a custom virtual environment. The results suggest that using a self-similar rather than a non-self-similar avatar positively influences the generation of original ideas; and that this depends on the influence of self-similarity on the link between identification and positive affect. Thus, this paper contributes a mechanism that explains how self-similar avatars support the generation of original ideas.","identification, idea generation, creativity, virtual environments, avatars, self-similarity, affect, originality"

For the methodology of this study, the researchers had to make use of a network lifecycle called Prepare, Plan, Design, Implement, Operate, and Optimize (PPDIOO) and there was also a need to combine both quantitative and qualitative research approach. To make this happen, the researchers had to fulfill the following objectives: a) determine the current network setup of L-NU, b) measure the current satisfaction level of the users, c) design, develop and implement a virtualized AAA network architecture, d) measure the satisfaction level of the users who have used the AAA network setup, and e) compare the measured satisfaction level from the users who used the internet facilities using the traditional network architecture and satisfaction level from users who have used the internet facilities after the implementation of AAA network architecture. As a result, it was found out that the implementation of the new network architecture has significantly improved the internet service level of L-NU which is reflected by a higher customer satisfaction rating. Therefore, the researchers conclude that it is most essential that AAA network architecture be implemented to enterprise type of network setup such as but not limited to education institutions in managing their internet services. Consequently, this kind of network architecture lead to a more effective and more efficient way of managing network resources of an institution or an organization while further improving the satisfaction level. In order to optimize the AAA network architecture and gain more implementation advantages, virtualization technology was used to contain and run numerous operating system instances such as four physical servers into one single physical server which favors to saving resources such as energy, space, money and of which also leads to simplified administration.","PPDIOO, authorization, virtualization, AAA, authentication, hypervisor, accounting, customer satisfaction"

Recent works have achieved impressive performance due to the rapid development of deep learning techniques. However, most existing methods have ignored the practical unbalanced property in real-world Re-ID scenarios. In fact, the number of pedestrian images in different cameras vary a lot. Some cameras cover thousands of images while others only have a few. As a result, the camera-unbalanced problem will reduce intra-camera diversity, then the model cannot learn camera-invariant features to distinguish pedestrians from poor cameras. In this paper, we design a novel camera-specific informative data augmentation module (CIDAM) to alleviate the proposed camera-unbalanced problem. Specifically, we first calculate the camera-specific distribution online, then refine the poor camera-specific covariance matrix with similar cameras defined in the prototype-based similarity matrix. Consequently, informative augmented samples are generated by combining original samples with sampled random vectors in feature space. To ensure these augmented samples can better benefit the model training, we further propose a dynamic-threshold-based contrastive loss. Since augmented samples may not be as real as original ones, we calculate a threshold for each original one dynamically and only push hard negative augmented samples away. Moreover, our CIDAM can be compatible with a variety of existing Re-ID methods.

However, conventional techniques for improving safety, such as testing and validation, do not meet this requirement, as shown by many of the real-world system failures in recent years, often with major economic and public-safety implications. We aim to improve the safety of critical CPS through synthesis of runtime enforcers, named safety guards, which are reactive components attached to the original systems to protect them against catastrophic failures. That is, even if the system occasionally malfunctions due to unknown defects, transient errors, or malicious attacks, the guard always reacts instantaneously to ensure that the combined system satisfies a predefined set of safety properties, and the deviation from the original system is kept at minimum. We illustrate the main ideas of this approach with examples, discuss the advantages compared to existing approaches, and point out some research challenges.","reactive synthesis, Safety and security, software synthesis, runtime enforcement, real-time schedulability"

Similar to the financial market trading, real-time bidding (RTB) based display advertising employs an auction mechanism to automate the impression level media buying; and running a campaign is no different than an investment of acquiring new customers in return for obtaining additional converted sales. Thus, how to optimally bid on an ad impression to drive the profit and return-on-investment becomes essential. However, the large randomness of the user behaviors and the cost uncertainty caused by the auction competition may result in a significant risk from the campaign performance estimation. In this paper, we explicitly model the uncertainty of user click-through rate estimation and auction competition to capture the risk. We borrow an idea from finance and derive the value at risk for each ad display opportunity. Our formulation results in two risk-aware bidding strategies that penalize risky ad impressions and focus more on the ones with higher expected return and lower risk. The empirical study on real-world data demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed risk-aware bidding strategies: yielding profit gains of 15.4% in offline experiments and up to 17.5% in an online A/B test on a commercial RTB platform over the widely applied bidding strategies.","risk-aware bidding strategy, demand-side platform, value at risk, real-time bidding, display advertising"

The new placement of edge-cloud services leverages resources both in Cloud Data Centers (CDC) and at the edge of the network. A computation task can be divided into subtasks and offloaded to different edge/cloud servers, which are donated as offloading destinations. Offloading destination heterogeneity and different architecture of Edge Data Center (EDC) and CDC bring challenges to computation offloading. One critical issue in edge-cloud computing is energy consumption in computation offloading. The existing computation offloading strategies either ignored energy consumption or ignored delay and/or security constraints.Meta-heuristic strategies have been used widely to design heuristic resource allocation algorithms in CDC. This paper aims to explore meta-heuristic energy-efficient computation offloading (EE-CO) approaches with the objective to meet the delay and security constraints, while minimizing energy consumption.

Different from existing approaches that rely heavily on feature engineering, we propose to use network embedding approach to address the problem, which can automatically represent nodes into lower dimensional feature vectors. However, there are two major limitations in recent studies on network embedding: (1) they are usually general-purpose embedding methods, which are independent of the specific tasks; and (2) most of these approaches can only deal with homogeneous networks, where the heterogeneity of the network is ignored. Hence, challenges faced here are two folds: (1) how to embed the network under the guidance of the author identification task, and (2) how to select the best type of information due to the heterogeneity of the network.To address the challenges, we propose a task-guided and path-augmented heterogeneous network embedding model. In our model, nodes are first embedded as vectors in latent feature space. Embeddings are then shared and jointly trained according to task-specific and network-general objectives. We extend the existing unsupervised network embedding to incorporate meta paths in heterogeneous networks, and select paths according to the specific task. The guidance from author identification task for network embedding is provided both explicitly in joint training and implicitly during meta path selection. Our experiments demonstrate that by using path-augmented network embedding with task guidance, our model can obtain significantly better accuracy at identifying the true authors comparing to existing methods.","task-guided, heterogeneous information networks, network embedding, author identification, path-augmented, meta path"

Uncertainties cause severe artifacts, which make the extracted features unsatisfying and hard to match.We try to alleviate the problem during matching by modeling the extracted features as Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). In the proposed method, given two feature maps of finger-vein, we first model inputs as GMM using the normal distribution transform, and then minimize the distance between two GMMs based on gradient descent, lastly we output the possibility that two feature maps belong to one person.To show its superiority, we replace conventional feature matching schemes with proposed method and test the performance gain based on two kinds of finger-vein features: finger-vein trajectory and finger-vein skeleton. Experimental results on the RATE dataset show that the proposed method is superior to the conventional methods in precision.","Gaussian Mixture Model, Biometrics, Finger-Vein Authentication"

This kind of dynamic analysis can be instrumental to reverse engineering, vulnerability discovery, exploit development, and debugging. While these analyses are typically well-supported for homogeneous desktop platforms (e.g., x86 desktop PCs), they can rarely be applied in the heterogeneous world of embedded systems. One approach to enable dynamic analyses of embedded systems is to move software stacks from physical systems into virtual environments that sufficiently model hardware behavior. This process which we call rehosting poses a significant research challenge with major implications for security analyses. Although rehosting has traditionally been an unscientific and ad-hoc endeavor undertaken by domain experts with varying time and resources at their disposal, researchers are beginning to address rehosting challenges systematically and in earnest. In this paper, we establish that emulation is insufficient to conduct large-scale dynamic analysis of real-world hardware systems and present rehosting as a firmware-centric alternative. Furthermore, we taxonomize preliminary rehosting efforts, identify the fundamental components of the rehosting process, and propose directions for future research.","firmware security, internet of things, dynamic program analysis, rehosting, virtualization, embedded systems, emulation"

We present the VirtualDrone Framework, a software architecture that enables an attack-resilient control of modern UAS. It allows the system to operate with potentially untrustworthy software environment by virtualizing the sensors, actuators, and communication channels. The framework provides mechanisms to monitor physical and logical system behaviors and to detect security and safety violations. Upon detection of such an event, the framework switches to a trusted control mode in order to override malicious system state and to prevent potential safety violations. We built a prototype quadcoper running an embedded multicore processor that features a hardware-assisted virtualization technology.

Our findings motivate us to revisit existing threat models for SDN-based cloud setups, and introduce a new attacker model for SDN-based cloud systems using virtual switches.We demonstrate the practical relevance of our analysis using a case study with Open vSwitch and OpenStack. Employing a fuzzing methodology, we find several exploitable vulnerabilities in Open vSwitch. Using just one vulnerability we were able to create a worm that can compromise hundreds of servers in a matter of minutes.Our findings are applicable beyond virtual switches: NFV and high-performance fast path implementations face similar issues.

One is security due to separation, where the hypervisor ensures that one domain does not compromise the execution of other domains. At the same time, the advances in the development of IoT applications opened discussions about the security flaws that were introduced by IoT devices. In a few years, billions of these devices will be connected to the cloud exchanging information. This is an opportunity for hackers to exploit their vulnerabilities, endangering applications connected to such devices.

Thus, a compromised container may break out of its isolated context and gain root access to the host server. This is a huge concern, especially in multi-tenant cloud environments where we can find running on a single server containers serving very different purposes, such as banking microservices, compute nodes or honeypots. Thus, containers with specific security needs should be able to tune their own security level.Because OS-level defense approaches inherited from time-sharing OS generally requires administrator rights and aim to protect the entire system, they are not fully suitable to protect usermode containers. Research recently made several contributions to deliver enhanced security to containers from host OS level to (partially) solve these challenges.In this survey, we propose a new taxonomy on container defense at the infrastructure level with a particular focus on the virtualization boundary, where interactions between kernel and containers take place. We then classify the most promising defense frameworks into these categories.","LSM, Container, Security, NFV, Virtualization Boundary, Virtualization"

Because of their location within the host, these agents are at risk of manipulation by malware and users. Additionally, in virtualized environments where multiple adjacent guests each run their own set of agents, the cumulative resources that agents consume adds up rapidly. Consolidating agents onto the hypervisor can address these problems, but places a technical burden on agent developers.This work presents a development methodology to re-engineer a host agent in to a hyperagent, an out-of-guest agent that gains unique hypervisor-based advantages while retaining its original in-guest capabilities. This three-phase methodology makes integrating Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) functionality in to existing code easier and more accessible, minimizing an agent developer's re-engineering effort. The benefits of hyperagents are illustrated by porting the GRR live forensics agent, which retains 89% of its codebase, uses 40% less memory than its in-guest counterparts, and enables a 4.9x speedup for a representative data-intensive workload. This work shows that a conventional off-the-shelf host agent can be feasibly transformed into a hyperagent and provide a powerful, efficient tool for defending virtualized systems.","cloud security, virtual machine introspection, computer forensics"

[IEEE S&P 2021] formalizes the notion of a coin mixing service and proposes A2L, a new cryptographic protocol that simultaneously achieves high efficiency and interoperability. In this work, we identify a gap in their formal model and substantiate the issue by showing two concrete counterexamples: we show how to construct two encryption schemes that satisfy their definitions but lead to a completely insecure system. To amend this situation, we investigate secure constructions of coin mixing services. First, we develop the notion of blind conditional signatures (BCS), which acts as the cryptographic core for coin mixing services. We propose game-based security definitions for BCS and propose A2L+, a modified version of the protocol by Tairi et al. that satisfies our security definitions. Our analysis is in an idealized model (akin to the algebraic group model) and assumes the hardness of the one-more discrete logarithm problem. Finally, we propose A2L-UC, another construction of BCS that achieves the stronger notion of UC-security (in the standard model), albeit with a significant increase in computation cost. This suggests that constructing a coin mixing service protocol secure under composition requires more complex cryptographic machinery than initially thought.","cryptanalysis, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, coin mixing services, universal composability, game-based security"

A recent trend in TEE development is the transition from vendor-controlled, single-purpose TEEs to open TEEs that host Trusted Applications (TAs) from multiple sources with independent tasks. This transition is expected to create a TA ecosystem needed for providing stronger and customized security to apps and OS running in the Rich Execution Environment (REE). However, the transition also poses two security challenges: enlarged attack surface resulted from the increased complexity of TAs and TEEs; the lack of trust (or isolation) among TAs and the TEE. In this paper, we first present a comprehensive analysis on the recent CVEs related to TEE and the need of multiple TEE scheme. We then propose TEEv, a TEE virtualization architecture that supports multiple isolated, restricted TEE instances (i.e., vTEEs) running concurrently. Relying on a tiny hypervisor (we call it TEE-visor), TEEv allows TEE instances from different vendors to run in isolation on the same smartphone and to host their own TAs. Therefore, a compromised vTEE cannot affect its peers or REE; TAs no longer have to run in untrusted/unsuitable TEEs. We have implemented TEEv on a development board and a real smartphone, which runs multiple commercial TEE instances from different vendors with very small porting effort.

In this paper, we argue that virtualization hardware, already available on many ARM processors, should be used for this purpose instead. Virtualization hardware can be used to implement multiple isolated trusted environments, as opposed to a single such environment provided by TrustZone. This can prevent the bloat of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) of the TEE and support new security services not currently possible, such as sandboxing of untrusted operating system kernel components.We also address the concerns for the use of virtualization for the aforementioned purpose. Most notably, through extensive experiments, we show that, unlike widespread belief, virtualization overhead is small if the hypervisor is carefully designed to minimize its interpositions into the operating system activity. In addition, we discuss and address the concerns on supported features, backward-compatibility, and hypervisor's TCB size.Going forward, given that virtualization provides a viable (if not superior) TEE solution, we suggest that ARM TrustZone hardware components should be mostly removed from future ARM SoCs. This can simplify the processor and SoC design and save some die space.","Operating systems, Security, Virtualization, Mobile devices"

Then, we propose a new architecture that provides a security mechanism by including a virtual firewall to protect cloud infrastructure from attacks and an IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection and Prevention System) in order to secure the virtual environment. To prove the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted experiments using open source solution called Open Source Security Event Correlator (OSSEC), we tested its ability to oversee the stat of virtual machines.

However, it is a challenging task to develop simulators for such processors, mainly, due to the lack of relevant information at the application level for computing performance parameters. This paper proposes a methodology to extract the required information from the hypervisor and transfer it to the hardware-based simulator for simulation of such processors. The paper proposes an approach to detect hypercalls made by the guest operating system during the execution of the guest application program on Xen hypervisor. This paper considers five hypercalls, viz., mmu_update, memory_op, update_va_mapping, grant_table_op and mmuext_op. The results show that for the guest application executed, among these five hypercalls, mmu_update is called the maximum number of times, while memory_op is called the minimum number of times. The paper also proposes an approach to signal the memory accesses by Xen on the communications (COM) port. This signal is observed on the cathode ray oscilloscope (CRO) and may be utilized for simulation. This research is valuable as it concludes that virtualization-enabled processors may be effectively simulated by extracting the required information from the hypervisor.","security, cloud computing, simulation, virtualization, computer architecture"

This constant stream of data connecting individuals and organizations across the globe has had a tremendous impact on the functioning of society and even has the power to sway elections. Despite having numerous benefits, social media has certain issues such as the prevalence of fake news which has also led to the rise of the hate speech phenomena. Due to lax security throughout these social media platforms, these issues continue to exist without any repercussions. This leads to cyberbullying, defamation and presents grave security concerns. Even though some work has been done independently on native scripts, hate speech detection and code-mixed data, there exists a lack of academic work and research in the area of detecting hate speech in transliterated code-mixed data and in-text containing native language scripts. Research in this field is inhibited greatly due to the multiple variations in grammar and spelling and in general a lack of availability of annotated datasets especially when it comes to native languages, this paper comes up with a method to automate hate speech detection in code mixed and native language text.

It works by injecting random noise into each query result such that it is provably hard for the adversary to infer the presence or absence of any individual record from the published noisy results. The main objective in differentially private query processing is to maximize the accuracy of the query results while satisfying the privacy guarantees. Previous work, notably Li et al. [2010], has suggested that, with an appropriate strategy, processing a batch of correlated queries as a whole achieves considerably higher accuracy than answering them individually. However, to our knowledge there is currently no practical solution to find such a strategy for an arbitrary query batch; existing methods either return strategies of poor quality (often worse than naive methods) or require prohibitively expensive computations for even moderately large domains. Motivated by this, we propose a low-rank mechanism (LRM), the first practical differentially private technique for answering batch linear queries with high accuracy. LRM works for both exact (i.e., ϵ-) and approximate (i.e., (ϵ, δ)-) differential privacy definitions. We derive the utility guarantees of LRM and provide guidance on how to set the privacy parameters, given the user's utility expectation. Extensive experiments using real data demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art query processing solutions under differential privacy, by large margins.","augmented Lagrangian multiplier algorithm, Linear counting query, matrix approximation, differential privacy, low rank"

Like Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX), SEV forms a foundation for confidential computing on untrusted machines; unlike SGX, SEV supports full VM encryption and thus makes porting applications straightforward. To date, many mainstream cloud service providers, including Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, have already adopted (or are planning to adopt) SEV for confidential cloud services. In this paper, we provide the first exploration of the security issues of TLB management on SEV processors and demonstrate a novel class of TLB Poisoning attacks against SEV VMs. We first demystify how SEV extends the TLB implementation atop AMD Virtualization (AMD-V) and show that the TLB management is no longer secure under SEV’s threat model, which allows the hypervisor to poison TLB entries between two processes of a SEV VM. We then present TLB Poisoning Attacks, a class of attacks that break the integrity and confidentiality of the SEV VM by poisoning its TLB entries.

The mix-zone confuses the tracker's sight by replacing the pseudonym when exiting the mix-zone, destroying the continuity of the location information, thereby ensuring vehicle safety. However, the mix-zone is generally distributed at traffic junctions such as intersections. There are many vehicles and there are restrictions such as traffic lights. Although the traffic volume is large, the speed of the vehicle is limited. Therefore, the attacker can lock the information by the relative time, position and speed of the pseudonyms to increase the pseudonym's linkability.Thereby greatly reducing the protection of the mix-zone. In this paper, for inference attacks, we group vehicles in the mix-zone according to the direction of the exit and add noise into the vehicle location data to reduce the tracking probability. At the same time, in the subsequent time, the vehicle location is slowly adjusted and restored to the actual value, reducing the impact of the noise on LBS(Location Based Service).","pseudonyms linking attacks, dummy location, location privacy, Mix-zone"

Customers of cloud services have to trust the cloud providers, as they control the building blocks that form the cloud. This includes the hypervisor enabling the sharing of a single hardware platform among multiple tenants. Executing in a higher-privileged CPU mode, the hypervisor has direct access to the memory of virtual machines. While data at rest can be protected using well-known disk encryption methods, data residing in main memory is still threatened by a potentially malicious cloud provider. AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) claims a new level of protection in such cloud scenarios. AMD SEV encrypts the main memory of virtual machines with VM-specific keys, thereby denying the higher-privileged hypervisor access to a guest's memory. To enable the cloud customer to verify the correct deployment of his virtual machine, SEV additionally introduces a remote attestation protocol. This protocol is a crucial component of the SEV technology that can prove that SEV protection is in place and that the virtual machine was not subject to manipulation. This paper analyzes the firmware components that implement the SEV remote attestation protocol on the current AMD Epyc Naples CPU series. We demonstrate that it is possible to extract critical CPU-specific keys that are fundamental for the security of the remote attestation protocol. Building on the extracted keys, we propose attacks that allow a malicious cloud provider a complete circumvention of the SEV protection mechanisms. Although the underlying firmware issues were already fixed by AMD, we show that the current series of AMD Epyc CPUs, i.e., the Naples series, does not prevent the installation of previous firmware versions. We show that the severity of our proposed attacks is very high as no purely software-based mitigations are possible. This effectively renders the SEV technology on current AMD Epyc CPUs useless when confronted with an untrusted cloud provider. To overcome these issues, we also propose robust changes to the SEV design that allow future generations of the SEV technology to mitigate the proposed attacks.","remote attestation, shielding systems, virtualization, secure encrypted virtualization, cloud computing, sev"

The generated sequences well preserve the movement information of the camera and objects, which expands the original data with longer sequence length to tackle the problem caused by insufficient data from the root. For more challenging datasets which suffer from background clutters, we propose an inter-view image generation with automatic end-to-end background substitution to eliminate the influence by the background and increase the diversity of the training data as well, which makes the recognition system learn to focus on the regions of objects and image features related to identity.

However, SVA provides no instructions for using hardware virtualization features such as Intel’s Virtual Machine Extensions (VMX) and AMD’s Secure Virtual Machine (SVM). Consequently, operating systems running on top of SVA cannot run guest operating systems using features such as Linux’s Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) and FreeBSD’s bhyve. This paper presents a set of new SVA instructions that allow an operating system kernel to configure and use the Intel VMX hardware features.

The bar for a successful attack can be raised significantly and the consequences of an attack can be contained. As Cyber-physical systems often comprise devices with limited resources, container virtualization provides an ideal base technology to construct secure architectures for CPS. However, the provided isolation guarantees entirely depend on one, shared kernel. Therefore, it is crucial to protect this kernel against attacks. Recent research proposed solutions to this issue. However, these approaches incurred performance penalties hindering their practical applicability. Therefore, we created GyroidOS, an architecture to shrink the kernel attack surface available to an attacker inside a container. To achieve this, we exploit redundancy in the Linux syscall interface to restrict access to syscalls without reducing the functionality available to user space binaries. Thereby, we aim to achieve maximum compatibility and applicability in real world scenarios. At the same time, GyroidOS aims to minimize the imposed performance penalty to avoid performance-related issues in the applicability of which previous approaches suffered.","system call hooking, attack surface reduction, binary rewriting, os-level virtualization security"

However, if the third-party providers are untrusted, they can inject poisoned samples into the datasets or embed backdoors in those models. Such an integrity breach can cause severe consequences, especially in safety- and security-critical applications. Various backdoor attack techniques have been proposed for higher effectiveness and stealthiness. Unfortunately, existing defense solutions are not practical to thwart those attacks in a comprehensive way.In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of data augmentation techniques in mitigating backdoor attacks and enhancing DL models' robustness. An evaluation framework is introduced to achieve this goal. Specifically, we consider a unified defense solution, which (1) adopts a data augmentation policy to fine-tune the infected model and eliminate the effects of the embedded backdoor; (2) uses another augmentation policy to preprocess input samples and invalidate the triggers during inference. We propose a systematic approach to discover the optimal policies for defending against different backdoor attacks by comprehensively evaluating 71 state-of-the-art data augmentation functions. Extensive experiments show that our identified policy can effectively mitigate eight different kinds of backdoor attacks and outperform five existing defense methods. We envision this framework can be a good benchmark tool to advance future DNN backdoor studies.","data augmentation, AI security, backdoor attacks, deep learning"

Except for the intra-modality variance that RGB-RGB person re-identification mainly overcomes, VI-ReID suffers from additional inter-modality variance caused by the inherent heterogeneous gap. To solve the problem, we present a carefully designed dual Gaussian-based variational auto-encoder (DG-VAE), which disentangles an identity-discriminable and an identity-ambiguous cross-modality feature subspace, following a mixture-of-Gaussians (MoG) prior and a standard Gaussian distribution prior, respectively. Disentangling cross-modality identity-discriminable features leads to more robust retrieval for VI-ReID. To achieve efficient optimization like conventional VAE, we theoretically derive two variational inference terms for the MoG prior under the supervised setting, which not only restricts the identity-discriminable subspace so that the model explicitly handles the cross-modality intra-identity variance, but also enables the MoG distribution to avoid posterior collapse. Furthermore, we propose a triplet swap reconstruction (TSR) strategy to promote the above disentangling process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two VI-ReID datasets.

The deviations are measured using the Kullback-Leibler divergence in a given one-dimensional exponential family, and take into account multiple arms at a time. They are obtained by constructing for each arm a mixture martingale based on a hierarchical prior, and by multiplying those martingales. Our deviation inequalities allow us to analyze stopping rules based on generalized likelihood ratios for a large class of sequential identification problems. We establish asymptotic optimality of sequential tests generalising the track-and-stop method to problems beyond best arm identification. We further derive sharper stopping thresholds, where the number of arms is replaced by the newly introduced pure exploration problem rank.

Many updates require a virtualization component restart or operating system reboot. Virtual machines (VMs) running on the updated servers must either be restarted or live migrated off. Reboots can result in downtime for the VMs on the order of ten minutes, and has further impact on the workloads running in the VMs because cached state is lost. Live migration (LM) is a technology that can avoid the need to shutdown VMs. However, LM requires turn space in the form of already-patched hosts, consumes network, CPU and other resources that scale with the amount of and level of activity of VM, and has variable impact on VM performance and availability, making it too expensive and disruptive for zero-day security updates that must be applied across an entire fleet on the order of hours. We present a novel update technology, virtual machine preserving host updates (VM-PHU), that does not require turn space, consumes no network and little CPU, preserves VM state, and causes minimal VM blackout time that does not scale with VM resource usage. VM-PHU persists the memory and device state of all running guest VMs, reboots the host and virtualization components into updated code, restores the state of the VMs, and then resumes them. VM-PHU makes use of several techniques to minimize VM blackout time. One is to use kernel soft reboot (KSR) to directly transition to an updated host operating system, bypassing firmware reset of the server and attached devices. To minimize resource consumption and VM disruption, VM-PHU leaves VM memory in physical memory pages and other state in persisted pages across the soft reboot, and VM-PHU implements a mechanism called fast close to enable a reboot to proceed without waiting for the completion of in-flight VM I/Os to remote storage devices. We have implemented VM-PHU in Microsoft Azure hosting millions of servers and show results of several zero-day updates that demonstrate VM blackout times on the order of seconds.

To separate security-sensitive operations from software executing on the main x86 cores, SEV leverages the AMD Secure Processor (AMD-SP). This paper introduces a new approach to attack SEV-protected virtual machines (VMs) by targeting the AMD-SP. We present a voltage glitching attack that allows an attacker to execute custom payloads on the AMD-SPs of all microarchitectures that support SEV currently on the market (Zen 1, Zen 2, and Zen 3). The presented methods allow us to deploy a custom SEV firmware on the AMD-SP, which enables an adversary to decrypt a VM's memory. Furthermore, using our approach, we can extract endorsement keys of SEV-enabled CPUs, which allows us to fake attestation reports or to pose as a valid target for VM migration without requiring physical access to the target host. Moreover, we reverse-engineered the Versioned Chip Endorsement Key (VCEK) mechanism introduced with SEV Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP). The VCEK binds the endorsement keys to the firmware version of TCB components relevant for SEV. Building on the ability to extract the endorsement keys, we show how to derive valid VCEKs for arbitrary firmware versions. With our findings, we prove that SEV cannot adequately protect confidential data in cloud environments from insider attackers, such as rogue administrators, on currently available CPUs.","secure encrypted virtualization, SEV, secure nested paging, SNP, voltage glitching, hardware fault attack"

To accurately approximate these distributions, Gaussian mixture model (GMM) was introduced to analyze the dynamic vessel trajectories. In particular, the optimal parameters of GMM were estimated using the iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Experiments on massive realistic vessel trajectories have demonstrated that there exists significantly different distributions of vessel speeds, spherical distances, longitude and latitude differences between downstream and upstream vessels.","Statistical analysis, Gaussian mixture model, Expectation-Maximization algorithm, Automatic identification system, Trajectory mining"

Recently, there are many platforms for NFV management and orchestration (MANO) are available, however few of them contains dedicated modules or components for security management. This paper is intended to study the feasibility of extending the current NFV orchestrator to have the capability of managing security mechanisms. To do that, we propose a security extension module based on TOSCA data model which is commonly used by NFV MANO architecture. We then develop an access control use case to illustrate the usage of our proposed security extension. Specifically, we integrate the security extension into the Moon framework, which can automatically verify security attributes, generate access control policies, and further enforce the policies through the underlying infrastructure according to the high-level security policies. The preliminary results show that our security extension can work together with the NFV orchestrator to enable fine-grained access control to protect resources and services.","security management, network functions virtualization (NFV), service orchestration, data model"

Surprisingly, many existing computational algorithms do not directly detect protein complexes based on both of these topological properties. Most of them, depending on mathematical definitions of either modularity or conductance, have their own limitations: Modularity has the inherent resolution problem ignoring small protein complexes; and conductance characterizes the separability of complexes but fails to capture the interaction density within complexes.We present a two-step algorithm FLCD (Finding Low-Conductance sets with Dense interactions) to predict overlapping protein complexes with the desired topological structure, which is densely connected inside and well separated from the rest of the networks. First, FLCD detects well-separated subnetworks based on approximating a potential low-conductance set through a personalized PageRank vector from each protein and then solving a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem to find the minimum-conductance set within the identified low-conductance set. At the second step, the densely connected parts in those subnetworks are discovered as the protein complexes by solving another MIP problem that aims to find the dense subnetwork in the minimum-conductance set. Experiments on four large-scale yeast PPI networks from different public databases demonstrate that the complexes predicted by FLCD have better correspondence with the yeast protein complex gold standards than other three state-of-the-art algorithms (ClusterONE, LinkComm, and SR-MCL). Additionally, results of FLCD show higher biological relevance with respect to Gene Ontology (GO) terms by GO enrichment analysis.","Protein complex identification, Dense subnetwork, Low conductance set, Mixed integer programming"

However, owing to the default assumption that outliers are not concentrated, unsupervised outlier detection may not correctly identify group anomalies with higher levels of density. Although high detection rates and optimal parameters can usually be achieved by using supervised outlier detection, obtaining a sufficient number of correct labels is a time-consuming task. To solve these problems, we focus on semi-supervised outlier detection with few identified anomalies and a large amount of unlabeled data. The task of semi-supervised outlier detection is first decomposed into the detection of discrete anomalies and that of partially identified group anomalies, and a distribution construction sub-module and a data augmentation sub-module are then proposed to identify them, respectively. In this way, the dual multiple generative adversarial networks (Dual-MGAN) that combine the two sub-modules can identify discrete as well as partially identified group anomalies. In addition, in view of the difficulty of determining the stop node of training, two evaluation indicators are introduced to evaluate the training status of the sub-GANs. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that the proposed Dual-MGAN can significantly improve the accuracy of outlier detection, and the proposed evaluation indicators can reflect the training status of the sub-GANs.","Discrete anomalies, data augmentation, partially identified group anomalies, distribution construction"

However, in recent years, with the Advancement of science and technology and the improvement of medical standards, in many clinical trials, there are some individuals who will not experience terminal events after treatment, that is, they will not relapse or die. The researchers believe that these individuals have been cured and call them long-term survivors. In this case, using the traditional Cox model and the AFT model will cause large errors and affect the judgment. Therefore, we consider applying a mixed healing model to the data. In the previous period, we have compared the model of proportional risk function and proportional risk mixed healing model and accelerated failure function model with accelerated failure mixed healing model. In this paper, we want to compare the predicted effects of the PHMC model and the AFTMC model. Methods: We use Monte Carlo simulations to generate data that satisfy and do not satisfy proportional assumptions. Using the consistency probability, the average square error of regression coefficient and 95% confidence interval to cover the original parameter as the evaluation index, the discriminant precision and fitting effect of the same data are compared. Result: For the survival data based on the assumption of proportional risk, the fitting effect of PHMC model is more accurate than that of AFTMC model. For the survival data based on the assumption that the proportional risk is not satisfied, the fitting effect of AFTMC model is better than that of PHMC model.

Unfortunately, these hardware-based technologies do not offer a unified interface for necessary tasks like secure key generation and usage or secure storage of integrity measurements. Moreover, these technologies are oftentimes limited in functionality especially regarding remote attestation. On the other hand, a unified interface is widely used in the area of bare-metal systems to provide these functionalities: the Trusted Platform Module (TPM).

Different from common approaches for virtual machines, host and hypervisor are not trusted and excluded from the trusted computing base. Our solution is compatible with existing mechanisms and tools utilizing TPMs and thus allows the protection of virtual machines in confidential computing environments without further adaptations of these mechanisms and tools. This includes storage of integrity measurements during a measured boot and for the integrity measurement architecture, full disk encryption bound to these measurements, usage of an openssl provider for TLS connections and remote attestation. We show how our concept can be applied to different hardware-specific technologies and implemented our concept for AMD SEV and SEV-SNP.","System Security, Measured Boot, Confidential Computing, TPM, Remote Attestation, Virtualization"

Specifically, the sensitive data is never revealed to clients, being protected by the runtime system. Our abstractions provide declarative and configurable data query interfaces, enforced by a lightweight distributed runtime system. Developers define when and how clients can query the sensitive data's properties (i.e., how long the data remains accessible, how many times its properties can be queried, which data query methods apply, etc.).

In such a scenario, the attacker can directly build a malicious container capable of hosting the victim app instead of tampering with it, thus neglecting any anti-repackaging protection developed so far. Also, existing anti-virtualization techniques are ineffective since the malicious container can intercept - and tamper with - such controls at runtime. So far, only two solutions have been specifically designed to address virtualization-based repackaging attacks. However, their effectiveness is limited since they both rely on static taint analysis, thus not being able to evaluate code dynamically loaded at runtime. To mitigate such a problem, in this paper we introduce MARVEL, the first methodology that allows preventing both traditional and virtualization-based repackaging attacks. MARVEL strongly relies on the virtualization technique to build a secure virtual environment where protected apps can run and be checked at runtime. To assess the viability and reliability of MARVEL, we implemented it in a tool, i.e., MARVELoid, that we tested by protecting 4000 apps with 24 different configurations of the protection parameters (i.e., 96k protection combinations). MARVELoid was able to inject the protection into 97.3% of the cases, with a processing time of 98 seconds per app on average. Moreover, we evaluated the runtime overhead on 45 apps, showing that the introduced protection has a negligible impact in terms of average CPU (<5%) and memory overhead (<0.5%).","Anti-repackaging techniques, Android Virtualization, Mobile Security"

While isolating code that manipulates critical secrets into an isolated execution environment is a promising countermeasure, existing approaches are either too coarse-grained to prevent intra-domain attacks, or require excessive intervention from low-level software (e.g., hypervisor or OS), or both. Further, few of them are applicable to large-scale software with millions of lines of code. This paper describes a new approach, namely SeCage, which retrofits commodity hardware virtualization extensions to support efficient isolation of sensitive code manipulating critical secrets from the remaining code. SeCage is designed to work under a strong adversary model where a victim application or even the OS may be controlled by the adversary, while supporting large-scale software with small deployment cost. SeCage combines static and dynamic analysis to decompose monolithic software into several compart- ments, each of which may contain different secrets and their corresponding code. Following the idea of separating control and data plane, SeCage retrofits the VMFUNC mechanism and nested paging in Intel processors to transparently provide different memory views for different compartments, while allowing low-cost and transparent invocation across domains without hypervisor intervention.We have implemented SeCage in KVM on a commodity Intel machine. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SeCage, we deploy it to the Nginx and OpenSSH server with the OpenSSL library as well as CryptoLoop with small efforts. Security evaluation shows that SeCage can prevent the disclosure of private keys from HeartBleed attacks and memory scanning from rootkits. The evaluation shows that SeCage only incurs small performance and space overhead.","memory disclosure, privacy protection, virtualization"

As RF fingerprinting models are sensitive to varying environmental and channel conditions, these factors should be taken into consideration when deep learning models are employed. As another option, data acquisition can be considered; however, it is infeasible since collecting samples of different circumstances for the training set is quite difficult. To address such aspects of RF fingerprinting, this paper applies various augmentation methods, namely, additive noise, generative models and channel profiling. Out of the studied augmentation methods, our results indicate that tapped delay line and clustered delay line (TDL/CDL) models seem to be the most viable solution as the accuracy to recognize transmitters can significantly increase from 74% to 87.94% on unobserved data.","deep learning, unmanned aerial vehicles, radio frequency fingerprinting, secure design, data augmentation"

While many online communities, be they online games or virtual worlds, have been created or used ostensibly with learning goals in mind, relatively little has been studied about how to motivate members collectively (rather than individually or in small groups) in productive activities, especially with children and teens. To this end we describe the design and impact of a virtual epidemic in a massive online community called Whyville.net that engaged youth players in an infectious disease outbreak. Our analyses of click data captured in log files and observations reveal which factors impacted players' changes in participation, including searches for information, engagement in prevention, and donations to vaccine design. In the discussion, we address what we have learned about identity, agency and timing as levers in designing participation in massive community experiences.","educational technology, identity, avatar design, computer supported collaborative learning, virtual communities, virtual worlds, virtual epidemics"

Specifically, cloud providers processing the network functions do not learn the network policies instructing how the functions are to be processed. First, we propose an abstract model of a generic network function based on match-action pairs. We assume that this function is processed in a distributed manner by multiple honest-but-curious cloud service providers. Then, we introduce our SplitBox system for private network function virtualization and present a proof-of-concept implementation on FastClick, an extension of the Click modular router, using a firewall as a use case. Our experimental results achieve a throughput of over 2 Gbps with 1 kB-sized packets on average, traversing up to 60 firewall rules.","Firewalls, Middlebox Privacy, Secret Sharing, Network Function Virtualization"

However, the configuration of avatar creation software may marginalise some groups of users due to them reinforcing social stereotypes that privilege youth and beauty, rather than representing the broader variety of human identities. Older adults are one group who may be disadvantaged with respect to avatars as avatar studies have typically focused on younger users. Considering that older populations are growing and that their participation in virtual environments is increasing, it is timely to investigate older adults' preferences in relation to avatars. We conducted a study with 23 participants (70+ years old) to understand the representational requirements of older adults when creating a humanoid virtual avatar. Our findings demonstrate that older adults are negotiating ageing stereotypes when creating a virtual body. These negotiations of body appearances range from: the Actual Avatar that by mirroring the self suggests an acceptance of the ageing body; the Vibrant Avatar that is idealising the physical condition of the self; the Other Avatar, that aims to explore other identities; and the Companion Avatar that creates another persona as company. These findings highlight that older adults have specific representational requirements when designing virtual avatars.","self-representation, older adults, identity, aging stereotypes, virtual avatars"

Three main lines of analysis were developed, the first of which was used to analyze the main elements defining the incorporation of youth into the sphere of digital technologies. The second interpretive framework looked at the role of social media in youth's construction of identity, and at the opportunities and main problems associated with their management of their intimate, private, and public lives. The third line of analysis looked in greater detail at the differences in use, appropriation, and incorporation of interconnected youth, based on social categories such as gender, media diet, political capital, or educational path that would act as social mediators in their virtual experience. Lastly, a number of conclusions were drawn emphasizing that young hyperconnected individuals live their experience of socialization and identity construction on the Network in a complex way, noting, nonetheless, that social networks can be an opportunity for the construction of social ties and development of democratic societies.","digital identities, interactive youth, technoculture, virtual social networks"

A cornerstone of these systems is the ability to protect the memory from unauthorized accesses. Despite this protection mechanism, previous attacks leveraged the control over memory resources to infer control flow of applications running in a shielded system.While previous works focused on a specific target application, there has been no general analysis on how the control flow of a protected application can be inferred. This paper tries to overcome this gap by providing a detailed analysis on the detectability of control flow using memory access patterns. To that end, we do not focus on a specific shielding system or a specific target application, but present a framework which can be applied to different types of shielding systems as well as to different types of attackers. By training a random forest classifier on the memory accesses emitted by syscalls of a shielded entity, we show that it is possible to infer the control flow of shielded entities with a high degree of accuracy.","secure encrypted virtualization, memory access patterns, side-channels, shielding systems"

Qualitative research instruments were designed to initially locate connections between conceptions of the self and symbolic pathways, and then to push out from conceptual paths to find boundaries and key connections between them. This paper details qualitative research into how an African university deploys place-based identity through its website, and how university students navigate through the university portal to desired information. This research uncovered whether the structure of a website reinforced audience notions of place through their use of metaphor, image, and navigation cues. The paper outlines the creation of the research instrument, discusses how early data collection guided later data collection, and finally details how these methods solicit users to define the significance of the data during research method shifts.","metaphor, framework negotiation, experience design, identity, mixed methods, field research, affordances, UX, place, metaphor theory"

Traditional IP routing protocols cannot provide such connectivity; thus an overlay network of encrypted HIP/IPsec tunnels can be used instead. However, the number of full-mesh tunnels between communicating devices grows exponentially to the number of devices thereby suggesting the investigation of alternatives. The introduction of relaying, which entails selecting a subset of hub routers to retain full-mesh connectivity, allows non-hub routers, the so-called spokes, to maintain connectivity via a hub. In this work, we study the effect of relay-based routing that minimizes the number of hubs, the connection cost between spokes and hubs, the cost of connecting hubs, and the hubs deployment cost. Additionally, we prove that this minimization problem is NP-hard and, thus, intractable for large scale networks. Therefore, we propose an algorithm with provable guarantees that provides an approximate but efficient solution. Initial simulation results indicate a reduction by more than 90% in the memory required for routing tables at the expense of a minor increase in the tunnel path length.","virtual private LAN services, routing, host identity protocol, approximation algorithm"

MazeStar is both a game (Mazzy) that teaches programming concepts like loops and conditionals, and a game editor which allows players to create and share their own game levels. By playing and creating, players are using computing concepts (e.g., block structuring, parallelism, etc.) and computing practices (e.g., debugging, iterative prototyping, etc.). To date the MazeStar platform has been used in controlled user studies involving > 10,000 participants. Here, our goal is to detail the different components of the MazeStar platform, and how we have/are leveraging these components to study the interplay of education, games/game-making, and virtual identity.","avatars, educational games, educational platforms, virtual identity"
