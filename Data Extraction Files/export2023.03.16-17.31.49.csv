"You Can’t Hide Behind Your Headset: User Profiling in Augmented and Virtual Reality","P. P. Tricomi; F. Nenna; L. Pajola; M. Conti; L.

Remote surgery, telerobotics, and virtual offices are only some examples of their successes. As users interact with XR, they generate extensive behavioral data usually leveraged for measuring human activity, which could be used for profiling users’ identities or personal information (e.g., gender). However, several factors affect the efficiency of profiling, such as the technology employed, the action taken, the mental workload, the presence of bias, and the sensors available. To date, no study has considered all of these factors together and in their entirety, limiting the current understanding of XR profiling. In this work, we provide a comprehensive study on user profiling in virtual technologies (i.e., AR, VR). Specifically, we employ machine learning on behavioral data (i.e., head, controllers, and eye data) to identify users and infer their individual attributes (i.e., age, gender). Toward this end, we propose a general framework that can potentially infer any personal information from any virtual scenarios. We test our framework on eleven generic actions (e.g., walking, searching, pointing) involving low and high mental loads, derived from two distinct use cases: an AR everyday application (34 participants) and VR robot teleoperation (35 participants). Our framework limits the burden of creating technology- and action-dependent algorithms, also reducing the experimental bias evidenced in previous work, providing a simple (yet effective) baseline for future works. We identified users up to 97% F1-score in VR and 80% in AR. Gender and Age inference was also facilitated in VR, reaching up to 82% and 90% F1-score, respectively. Through an in-depth analysis of sensors’ impact, we found VR profiling resulting more effective than AR mainly because of the eye sensors’ presence.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3240071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10027854","Augmented reality;machine learning;metaverse;privacy;user profiling;virtual reality","Privacy;X reality;Sensors;Security;Metaverse;Behavioral sciences;Surgery;Machine learning;Augmented reality;Virtual reality","augmented reality;learning (artificial intelligence);telerobotics","age inference;augmented reality;behavioral data;extended reality;eye data;eye sensors;gender;personal information;remote connections;user profiling;virtual offices;virtual reality;virtual scenarios;virtual technologies;VR profiling;XR profiling","","","","71","CCBY","27 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this experimental study, the aim is to develop a novel authentication technique with a fusion of graphical doodle password approach and AR environments. The mash-up of both doodle passwords and AR in a 3D space gives a promising direction to set off to a modern, more usable, and satisfying authentication techniques. The proposed approach works on real-time size and coordinate matching of doodles in an AR environment for the authentication of users. The creation of doodle passwords in an AR space is carried on by touch-gesture-recognition on a smartphone. The usability and usefulness of the proposed technique is evaluated by conducting an extensive survey, based on tasks and user experience assessments. The randomized-post-test-only study model is used to conduct experimentation that is also followed by the analysis of security parameters with the help of confusion matrix.

The Metaverse is a product (or something similar as we do not yet know its final form) of such technologies. In this circumstance, when applications that utilize the Metaverse are used, there seem to be no transportation charges, and there is no cap on amounts of individuals, users, players, learners, or trainee who can take part. Hence, and due to such a feature, the Metaverse has attracted various researchers from different fields where it has been exploited by them to contribute to those fields and research areas. As for example, it is possible to teach various target audiences by offering different events and classes from any location in the globe. In order for a participant to utilize the Metaverse, there are necessary conditions to be considered as well as other settings to be initialized. In line of this, virtual reality, augmented reality, availability of required sensors, smart glasses, headsets, and few others are considered some examples of such conditions and settings that the Metaverse requires. Despite the advantages that Metaverse offers us, there are a number of considerations that must be taken into account while developing it by interested researchers. One of these concerns is the Metaverse privacy regarding the participants (represented as avatars inside the Metaverse environment). Another issue is that since the Metaverse is still in its early stages, many attempts have to be made from interested researchers who engage to develop it to enhancing it. This review aims to survey related articles that concern the Metaverse and its development providing a review of the chronological stages throughout the history of the development of Metaverse. It aims also to list a number of recent technological advances allowing the Metaverse. Besides, Metaverse’s definitions, properties, architecture, and applications have been discussed and listed in this review.

Moreover, with the rise of massive internet-of-things, and automation, technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have emerged as prominent players to drive a range of applications. Currently, sixth-generation (6G) networks support enhanced holographic projection through terahertz (THz) bandwidths, ultra-low latency, and massive device connectivity. However, the data is exchanged between autonomous networks over untrusted channels. Thus, to ensure data security, privacy, and trust among stakeholders, blockchain (BC) opens new dimensions towards intelligent resource management, user access control, audibility, and chronology in stored transactions. Thus, the BC and 6G coalition in future AR/VR applications is an emerging investigative topic. To date, authors have proposed surveys that study the integration of BC and 6G in AR/VR in isolation, and hence a coherent survey is required. Thus, to address the gap, the survey is the first-of-its-kind to investigate and study the coalition of BC and 6G in AR/VR space. Based on the proposed research questions in the survey, a solution taxonomy is presented, and different verticals are studied in detail. Furthermore, an integrative architecture is proposed, and open issues and challenges are presented. Finally, a case study, BvTours, is presented that presents a unique survey on BC-based 6G-assisted AR/VR virtual home tour service.

However, since the conventional online environments typically provide simple streaming services using cameras and microphones, there have limitations in terms of physical expression and experiencing real-world activities such as cultural and economic activities. Recently, metaverse environments, three-dimensional virtual reality that use avatars, have attracted increasing attention as a means to solve these problems. Thus, many metaverse platforms such as Roblox, Minecraft, and Fortnite have been emerging to provide various services to users. However, such metaverse environments are potentially vulnerable to various security threats because the users and platform servers communicate through public channels. In addition, sensitive user data such as identity, password, and biometric information are managed by each platform server. In this paper, we design a system model that can guarantee secure communication and transparently manage user identification data in metaverse environments using blockchain technology. We also propose a mutual authentication scheme using biometric information and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to provide secure communication between users and platform servers and secure avatar interactions between avatars and avatars. To demonstrate the security of the proposed mutual authentication scheme, we perform informal security analysis, Burrows–Abadi–Needham (BAN) logic, Real-or-Random (ROR) model, and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA). In addition, we compare the computation costs, communication costs, and security features of the proposed scheme with existing schemes in similar environments. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has lower computation and communication costs and can provide a wider range of security features than existing schemes.

The increasing need for safe and efficient teleoperation requires advanced environmental awareness and collision avoidance. The up-to-date screen-based 2D or 3D interfaces do not fully allow the operator to immerse in the controlled scenario. This problem can be addressed with the emerging Mixed Reality (MR) technologies with Head-Mounted Devices (HMDs) that offer stereoscopic immersion and interaction with virtual objects. Such human-robot interfaces have not yet been demonstrated in telerobotic interventions in particle physics accelerators. Moreover, the operations often require a few experts to collaborate, which increases the system complexity and requires sharing an Augmented Reality (AR) workspace. The multi-user mobile telerobotics in hazardous environments with shared control in the AR has not yet been approached in the state-of-the-art. In this work, the developed MR human-robot interface using the AR HMD is presented. The interface adapts to the constrained wireless networks in particle accelerator facilities and provides reliable high-precision interaction and specialized visualization. The multimodal operation uses hands, eyes and user motion tracking, and voice recognition for control, as well as offers video, 3D point cloud and audio feedback from the robot. Multiple experts can collaborate in the AR workspace locally or remotely, and share or monitor the robot’s control. Ten operators tested the interface in intervention scenarios in the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) with complete network characterization and measurements to conclude if operational requirements were met and if the network architecture could support single and multi-user communication load. The interface system has proved to be operationally ready at the Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 8 and was validated through successful demonstration in single and multi-user missions. Some system limitations and further work areas were identified, such as optimizing the network architecture for multi-user scenarios or high-level interface actions applying automatic interaction strategies depending on network conditions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3245833","CERN; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10045681","Augmented Reality;facility maintenance;hand tracking;hazardous environment;human–robot interaction;mixed reality;mobile robotic manipulator;mobile network;multi-user;safe operations;point cloud;spatial perception;telerobotics;voice control","Mobile robots;Collision avoidance;Robot sensing systems;Augmented reality;Three-dimensional displays;Collaboration;Human factors;Safety;Telerobotics","","","","","","68","CCBY","15 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since odors are made up of volatile compounds at low concentration, they can be used for olfactory-based identification. The article outlines the development of an olfactory-based AR system to help with the identification of maintenance issues using smell. The prototype comprises of three components: an electronic nose, a database and an AR application integrated with Microsoft HoloLens. After diagnosing an odor, the data is sent wirelessly through a local network to the HMD worn by the user. To validate the technology, four odors have been used, including engine oil, sun lotion, medical alcohol and perfume, to record behaviors and demonstrate the repeatability of the process.

In this process, industrial robots play a key role. Even if repeatability, precision and velocity of the industrial manipulators enable reaching considerable production levels, factories are required to face an increasingly competitive market, which requires being able to dynamically adapt to different situations and conditions. Hence, facilities are moving toward systems that rely on the collaboration between humans and machines. Human workers should understand the behavior of the robots, placing trust in them to properly collaborate. If a fault occurs on a manipulator, its movements are suddenly stopped for security reasons, thus workers may not be able to understand what happened to the robot. Therefore, the operators' stress and anxiety may increase, compromising the human-robot collaborative scenario. This work fits in this context and it proposes an adaptive Augmented Reality system to display industrial robot faults by means of the Microsoft HoloLens device. Starting from the methodology employed to identify which virtual metaphors best evoke robot faults, an adaptive modality is presented to dynamically display the metaphors in positions close to the fault location, always visible from the user and not occluded by the manipulator. A comparison with a non adaptive modality is proposed to assess the effectiveness of the adaptive solution. Results show that the adaptive modality allows users to recognize faults faster and with fewer movements than the non adaptive one, thus overcoming the limitation of the narrow field-of-view of the HoloLens device.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2940887","HuManS (Human Centered Manufacturing Systems); Bando Piattaforma Tecnologica Fabbrica Intelligente POR FESR 2014/2020; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8832130","Augmented reality;collaborative robotics;fault visualization;industry 40","Service robots;Manipulators;Collaboration;Visualization;Industries;Augmented reality","augmented reality;control engineering computing;fault diagnosis;human-robot interaction;industrial manipulators;production engineering computing","industrial robot faults;Microsoft HoloLens device;adaptive modality;manipulator;nonadaptive modality;industrial robotic tasks;automated systems;industrial robots;industrial manipulators;security reasons;human-robot collaborative scenario;adaptive augmented reality system","","17","","60","CCBY","11 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Rather than providing a formal definition of the Metaverse, we list four must-have characteristics of the Metaverse: socialization, immersive interaction, real world-building, and expandability. These characteristics not only carve the Metaverse into a novel and fantastic digital world, but also make it suffer from all security/privacy risks, such as personal information leakage, eavesdropping, unauthorized access, phishing, data injection, broken authentication, insecure design, and more. This paper first introduces the four characteristics, then the current progress and typical applications of the Metaverse are surveyed and categorized into four economic sectors. Based on the four characteristics and the findings of the current progress, the security and privacy issues in the Metaverse are investigated. We then identify and discuss more potential critical security and privacy issues that can be caused by combining the four characteristics.

To this end, a user study involving a needle insertion task was conducted comparing different AR display techniques with a monitor-based approach as baseline condition for the visualization of navigation information. A video see-through stationary display, an optical see-through head-mounted display and a spatial AR projector-camera-system were investigated in this comparison. Results suggest advantages of using projected navigation information in terms of lower task completion time, lower angular deviation and affirmative subjective participant feedback. Techniques requiring the intermediate view on screens, i.e. the stationary display and the baseline condition, showed less favorable results. Thus, benefits of providing AR navigation information compared to a conventionally used method could be identified. Significant objective measures results, as well as an identification of advantages and disadvantages of individual display techniques contribute to the development and design of improved needle navigation systems.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3023637","German Research Foundation(grant numbers:HA 7819/1-2 & LA 3855/1-2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9211732","Medical augmented reality;display techniques;surgical navigation systems;needle guidance;visuospatial task","Navigation;Augmented reality;Biomedical monitoring;Navigation;Data visualization;Phantoms;Optical imaging","augmented reality;data visualisation;helmet mounted displays;human factors;medical computing;needles","specific displaying devices;needle insertion task;stationary display;head-mounted display;projector-camera-system;navigation information;task completion time;angular deviation;AR navigation information;conventionally used method;needle navigation systems;AR display techniques;AR navigation systems;hand-eye coordination;mental workload;medical needle insertion;augmented reality display techniques","Adult;Augmented Reality;Computer Graphics;Female;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Male;Models, Biological;Needles;Phantoms, Imaging;Surgery, Computer-Assisted;Torso;Young Adult","6","","47","CCBY","2 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Navantia, a company that has been building ships for 300 years, is modernizing its shipyards according to the Industry 4.0 principles with the help of the latest technologies. Augmented reality (AR), which when utilized in an industrial environment is called industrial AR (IAR), is one of such technologies, since it can be applied in numerous situations in order to provide useful and attractive interfaces that allow shipyard operators to obtain information on their tasks and to interact with certain elements that surround them. This article first reviews the state of the art on IAR applications for shipbuilding and smart manufacturing. Then, the most relevant IAR hardware and software tools are detailed, as well as the main use cases for the application of IAR in a shipyard. Next, it is described Navantia's IAR system, which is based on a fog-computing architecture. Such a system is evaluated when making the use of three IAR devices (a smartphone, a tablet, and a pair of smart glasses), two AR software development kits (ARToolKit and Vuforia) and multiple IAR markers, with the objective of determining their performance in a shipyard workshop and inside a ship under construction. The results obtained show a remarkable performance differences among the different IAR tools and the impact of factors like lighting, pointing out the best combinations of markers, and hardware and software to be used depending on the characteristics of the shipyard scenario.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2802699","Plant Information and Augmented Reality research line of the Navantia-UDC Joint Research Unit; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8281493","Augmented Reality;cyber-physical systems;identification;industrial augmented reality;industry 4.0;Internet of Things;traceability;industrial Internet of Things;smart factory","Industries;Hardware;Marine vehicles;Augmented reality;Maintenance engineering;Companies;Software","augmented reality;factory automation;mobile computing;production engineering computing;production facilities;shipbuilding industry","software tools;AR software development kits;ship;commercial industrial augmented reality systems;manufacturing companies;automated factories;computerized factories;shipbuilding;shipyard operators;smart manufacturing;Navantia;hardware tools;Industry 4.0 shipyard;fog-computing architecture;IAR markers;time 300.0 year","","108","","90","OAPA","5 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As for the considered case study on gamma radiation measurements, an ad-hoc AR application along with a microcontroller-based prototype allows students, located in a safe classroom, to (i) control distance and orientation of a remote actual detector with respect to different radioactive sources and (ii) retrieve and display on their smartphones the corresponding energy spectrum.

In this study, we propose a real-time system designed to provide plausible visual and tactile simulation of the main surgical procedures. To achieve this, the physical properties of organs are modeled by particles, and cluster-based shape matching is used to simulate soft deformation. The haptic interaction between tools and soft tissue is modeled as a collision between a capsule and particles. Constraint-based haptic rendering is used to generate feedback force and the non-penetrating position of the virtual tool. The proposed system can simulate the major steps of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, such as the anatomy of Calot's triangle, clipping of the cystic duct and biliary artery, disjunction of the cystic duct and biliary artery, and separation of the gallbladder bed. The experimental results show that haptic rendering can be performed at a high frequency (> 900 Hz), whereas mesh skinning and graphics rendering can be performed at 60 frames per second (fps).","2096-9929","","10.23919/CSMS.2022.0009","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902014); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:4214066); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9841530","virtual surgery;laparoscopic cholecystectomy;position-based dynamics","Laparoscopes;Visualization;Shape;Ducts;Surgery;Rendering (computer graphics);Real-time systems","biological organs;biological tissues;computer based training;haptic interfaces;medical computing;rendering (computer graphics);surgery;virtual reality","time laparoscopic cholecystectomy simulation;particle-based physical system;cholecystitis;cholelithiasis;novice doctors;VR-based surgical simulation;plausible visual simulation;tactile simulation;cluster-based shape matching;soft deformation;haptic interaction;soft tissue;constraint-based haptic rendering;nonpenetrating position;virtual tool;cystic duct;biliary artery;Calot triangle","","","","28","","26 Jul 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Due to the large area coverage of agriculture and the variety of production objects, if all farmland perception information is gathered into the cloud server, the server will exert greater pressure on the network, which reduces the speed of response to event processing. This problem may be perfectly solved by the recent emergence of Edge computing, which can share the load of the cloud server and reduce the delay. Edge computing has prospects in agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. The application of the Agricultural Internet of Things integrates artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and blockchain and Virtual/Augmented Reality technologies. This paper primarily reviews the application of Edge computing in the Agricultural Internet of Things and investigates the combination of Edge computing and Artificial Intelligence, blockchain and Virtual/Augmented reality technology.

We reviewed previous literature to identify applicable constructs and questionnaire items, and performed a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the data from three experiments (N = 196). The analysis confirmed three factors: (1) ownership of a virtual body, (2) agency over a virtual body, and (3) the perceived change in the body schema. A fourth study (N = 22) was conducted to confirm the reliability and validity of the scale, by investigating the impacts of latency and latency jitter present in the simulation.

A major obstacle to such solutions is virtuality–reality-synthesized threats. Therefore, it is imperative to design new paradigms to defend the metaverse effectively. In this article, we advance a parallel system, dubbed ParaDefender, to defend the metaverse against emerging new threats effectively. Inspired by parallel intelligence, ParaDefender comprises artificial cyberspace, computational experiments, and parallel execution. The basic idea is to make artificial and real cyberspaces executed in parallel to mutually guide each other for enhanced security, wherein the parallel execution is scenario driven in the sense that the scenarios originate from all possible spatial–temporal combinations of security threats in the metaverse.

Typically, these symptoms are monitored through self-report measures, such as the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ); however, by only using subjective measures many symptoms may be overlooked. In an application-based study, we investigated visual and cognitive aftereffects of using HMDs and their relationship to the reporting of sickness on the SSQ. Visual (accommodation and vergence) and cognitive (reaction time and rapid visual processing) assessments were employed before and after participants engaged in a 30-minute VR table tennis game (VR group, n = 27) or went about their daily activities (control group, n = 28). The data showed changes in accommodation but no concurrent changes in vergence, which likely stems from decoupling accommodation and vergence in VR. Furthermore, larger changes in accommodation were linked to more severe sickness symptoms suggesting that decoupling accommodation and vergence could be more adverse than previously thought. The VR group also had slower decision (cognitive) times, but movement times were unaffected. These findings go beyond the typical self-reporting of sickness in VR studies. Moreover, we demonstrate that even in a high-quality commercial virtual environment, users may experience visual and cognitive aftereffects that may negatively influence their experience with subsequent activities in the real world. Developing an understanding of how VR aftereffects may influence later activities could help to minimise the risk of using HMDs for various applications and may be valuable to obtain a better understanding of user issues and VR safety.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2940073","URIPA Grant; Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; National Health and Medical Research Council(grant numbers:GNT1136269); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8827502","Aftereffects;motion sickness;depth perception;vergence-accommodation conflict","Visualization;Fatigue;Virtual environments;Games;Sports;Stereo image processing","cognition;computer games;helmet mounted displays;human computer interaction;medical computing;virtual reality","reaction time;rapid visual processing;30-minute VR table tennis game;VR group;control group;concurrent changes;severe sickness symptoms;slower decision times;VR studies;high-quality commercial virtual environment;experience visual aftereffects;cognitive aftereffects;VR aftereffects;VR safety;sick;continued improvements;virtual reality technologies;experience adverse symptoms;head-mounted displays;self-report measures;Simulator Sickness Questionnaire;SSQ;subjective measures;application-based study;HMD","","31","","49","CCBY","9 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Second, we propose an efficient algorithm to assess the feasibility of these DPs. Comprehensive experiments on linear hyper-plane regression and non-linear homography matrix estimation show that our approach is fully deterministic and can effectively process large-scale and highly corrupted data without any special initialization.

Compared with offline channels, the online channel is at a disadvantage with regards to the product experience. For experience products, consumers cannot accurately access the value of the products through online channels because of its virtuality. In contrast, offline channels can attract more consumers with real product experience. However, the application of virtual reality technology has become increasingly more extensive in recent years. Virtual reality technology enhances the interaction level between online consumers and experience products, and it can help consumers assess product value more accurately, which has a greater impact on consumers’ purchase decisions. Manufacturers can make full use of virtual reality technology to expand online sales. To maximize the manufacturers’ revenue, this paper uses consumer utility theory and game theory to design four experience products’ distribution channel models and analyzes the relationship between the manufacturers’ revenue in different distribution channel models and virtual reality technology. The results show when the interaction level of virtual reality technology is low, manufacturers tend to choose a dual distribution channel, but when the interaction level of virtual reality technology is high, a single online distribution channel is the best choice for manufacturers.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2920308","China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201608430270); Social Science of Hunan Province(grant numbers:17YBA127); Education Department of Hunan Province(grant numbers:15B070,18A172); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8727960","Virtual reality technology;experience products;consumer utility;game theory;distribution channel;purchase decisions","Virtual reality;Game theory;Consumer behavior;Channel models;Switches;Supply chains;Utility theory","consumer behaviour;electronic commerce;game theory;Internet;pricing;purchasing;retail data processing;utility theory;virtual reality","experience products;product distribution channels;channel cost;consumer fairness preference;channel coordination;channel selection;product experience;offline channels;virtual reality technology;online consumers;product value;consumer utility theory;game theory;dual distribution channel;single online distribution channel;consumer purchase decisions","","1","","30","OAPA","3 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional methods are used to construct fuzzy feature indexes of mobile terminal video images, and the detailed information of video images is divided, but the bidirectional matching of feature points is ignored, which leads to low extraction accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for extracting fuzzy features of mobile terminal video images based on SURF-based virtual reality technology. First, perform video image grayscale extraction on the input mobile terminal video image, and detect the closed area in the mobile terminal video image as the radiation invariant area of the terminal video image. Secondly, Hessian matrix is used to detect the feature points of the image, and the non-maximum suppression method and interpolation operation are used to find and locate the extreme value points. Then, the main direction of feature points was determined, and SURF description operator was used for matching to obtain initial matching point pairs. Finally, the obtained fuzzy feature one-way matching result of the video image is matched in two directions, the closest distance ratio is used to match the feature points, and the full constraint condition is used to filter out the wrong matching point pairs, thereby completing the mobile terminal video image fuzzy feature extraction. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effective in feature extraction and matching, stability and speed. The misrecognition rate of the algorithm in this paper is 0.101, and the time used is only 0.41 s, which fully meets the real-time requirements.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3019070","Major online teaching reform project of Anhui Province: Research and Practice of online Blended Teaching Mode based on MOOC in the Era of “Internet” – Take C Language Program Design as an example(grant numbers:2020zdxsjg263); Natural science research project of Anhui Province: Channel allocation optimization in wireless Mesh network(grant numbers:KJ2019A0950); Horizontal Project of production, teaching and research: Research on key technologies of intelligent monitoring based on abnormal behavior identification(grant numbers:2019FXGHK1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9174977","Feature extraction;mobile terminal;video image;SURF;virtual reality technology","Feature extraction;Virtual reality;Lighting;Data mining;Education;Gray-scale;Real-time systems","feature extraction;fuzzy set theory;Hessian matrices;image matching;interpolation;object detection;virtual reality","real-time requirements;misrecognition rate;one-way matching;SURF description operator;interpolation operation;nonmaximum suppression method;Hessian matrix;radiation invariant area;extraction accuracy;bidirectional matching;fuzzy feature extraction simulation;mobile terminal video image;video image grayscale extraction;SURF-based virtual reality technology;feature points;fuzzy feature indexes;low illumination image quality","","4","","32","CCBY","24 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moving target balance ability detection plays an important role in public security, traffic monitoring and other fields, and is also a basic technology for many vision applications. Therefore, the requirements for accuracy and completeness of detection are getting higher and higher. This article proposes a tracking method Motion Model and Model Updater (MMMU) based on the balance acquisition and model update and intelligent adjustment of the motion model. Improved Motion Model (IMM) is a background sample balance acquisition algorithm based on simple linear iterative clustering, completes the abstraction of background images. Different from other update strategies with a fixed number of frames, the update strategy based on image histogram contrast relies on the human selective forgetting mechanism to better avoid burst frames and process similar frames. Since the data used to detect the balance ability of moving targets is inherently unbalanced, the idea of dealing with imbalance in data mining is introduced into it, and the problem of balance ability detection of moving targets is studied from the perspectives of downsampling and oversampling. In addition, temporal and spatial oversampling of the foreground and selective downsampling of the background are performed to reduce the imbalance of the data set, and the resampled data set is used for modeling and classification. The feasibility of the MMMU algorithm is tested through experiments, and the motion balance ability of the foreground target is detected relatively completely.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3019609","Teaching Reform of the China University of Petroleum: Research on the Supply Side of College Physical Education-Big Data Analysis Based on Academic Performance and Physical Characteristics(grant numbers:JY-B201888); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9178336","Movement target balance ability detection;movement balance ability;balance acquisition;VR~environment","Solid modeling;Virtual reality;Computational modeling;Data models;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Object detection","computer vision;image classification;image motion analysis;image sampling;iterative methods;object detection;object tracking;pattern clustering;video signal processing;virtual reality","computer vision;background sample balance acquisition algorithm;linear iterative clustering;background images;image histogram contrast;human selective forgetting mechanism;classification;foreground target detection;video analysis;virtual reality environment;smart camera devices;motion model and model updater;motion balance ability detection;moving target balance ability detection;tracking method;MMMU;improved motion model;temporal oversampling;spatial oversampling;selective downsampling","","","","34","CCBY","26 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article proposes a method to evaluate the risk of runway excursion accidents in the high-plateau airport with the probability and severity estimations of runway excursion in the high-plateau airport. Firstly, the probability estimation is calculated by combining the correction model and the Bayesian network. The probability correction model considers the runway length required for takeoff and landing, specific ambient temperature, and wind speeds in the high-plateau airport. Then, a high-plateau airport simulation evacuation model of evacuation capacity is established by the VR experiment, and the severity of evacuation in the high-plateau airport is evaluated, combining the endurance of fire products. Finally, based on probability and severity, the quantitative calculation value of risk is given. We also utilize the model on a case study to find the effect of temperature, wind speed, and altitude on this risk index. The results show that the risk of runway excursion accidents in the high-plateau airport is greatly affected by temperature and wind speed. The experimental airport's risk value in February is about 11.8 times of that in September, and the risk value of the high-plateau airport is 7.32 times higher than that in a plain airport. The model successfully simulates the various scenarios at a high-plateau airport and other airports at different altitudes. It is proved that the fire risk of high-plateau airport runway excursion accidents should be paid attention to and provides scientific guidance for the airport's aviation safety management based on the actual characteristics of a high-plateau airport.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3035894","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFC0809500); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71874081); Qing Lan Project(grant numbers:2020); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:kfjj20190722); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9247976","Risk assessment;high-plateau airport;runway excursion;probability;severity","Analytical models;Atmospheric modeling;Wind speed;Estimation;Airports;Risk management;Accidents","accidents;aerospace safety;airports;belief networks;fire safety;probability;risk analysis;virtual reality","aviation safety management;risk index;fire products;VR experiment;high-plateau airport simulation evacuation model;wind speeds;specific ambient temperature;runway length;probability correction model;Bayesian network;severity estimations;risk management;risk assessment;runway excursion accidents;fire risk analysis","","2","","54","CCBY","4 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a dual-path deep CNN (TDCNN) TSR model is built based on the convolutional neural network (CNN), and the cost function and recognition accuracy are selected as indicators to analyze the training results of the model. Second, the recurrent neural network (RNN) and long-short-term memory (LSTM) RNN are utilized to assess the road traffic safety risks, and the prediction and evaluation effects of them are compared. Finally, the changes in safety risks of road traffic accidents are analyzed based on the two key influencing factors of the number of road intersections and the speed of vehicles traveling. The results show that the learning rate of the network model and the number of hidden neurons in the fully-connected layer directly affect the training results, and there are differences in the choices between the early and late training periods. Compared with RNN, the LSTM network model has higher evaluation accuracy, and its corresponding root square error (RSE) is 0.36. The rational control of the number of intersections and the speed of roads traveled has a significant impact on improving the safety level and promoting road traffic efficiency.

To address this issue, this paper presents two main contributions. First, we demonstrate, through practical examples, that the risk associated with iris-based identification by means of images collected from public websites and social media is real. Second, we propose an innovative method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) that can automatically generate novel images with high visual realism, in which all the biometric information associated with an individual in the iris region has been removed and replaced.

One of the basic architectures for NR-U involves carrier aggregation of an anchor-licensed-NR carrier and a secondary carrier in unlicensed spectrum, which altogether allows for seamless traffic offloading in scenarios where multi-gigabit data rates are required. While today's research on NR-U addresses mostly physical- and protocol-layer aspects, a system-level performance of the NR-U offloading mechanisms has not been investigated thoroughly. In this paper, we develop a mathematical queuing-theoretic framework that is mindful of the specifics of millimeter-wave (mmWave) session dynamics and may serve as a flexible tool for the analysis of various strategies for the integrated use of licensed and unlicensed mmWave bands in terms of the session drop probability and system utilization. To illustrate this, we select three distinct strategies (based on sequential service, probabilistic offloading, or proportional splitting), and complement our mathematical models with a detailed performance evaluation in a representative massive augmented/virtual reality scenario. Based on this quantitative analysis of the selected schemes, we conclude that proportional splitting of traffic between the two mmWave bands leads to a better performance.

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)’s Multipath Transmission Control Protocol (MPTCP) can aggregate bandwidth and balance traffic across multiple subflows in a heterogeneous network environment. However, in order to support delivery of high quality 5G media services, researchers should also address MPTCP’s inefficient data scheduling to heterogenous sub-paths, consideration of multiple criteria, including energy consumption and its inconsistent behavior when employed along with the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) adaptive application layer protocol. To address these issues, we propose a Q-Learning driven Energy-aware Data Scheduling (QLE-DS) mechanism for MPTCP-based media services. QLE-DS models the multipath scheduling as a Q-learning process and employs a novel quantum clustering approach to discretize the high dimensional continuous Q-table. An asynchronous framework is designed to improve the learning efficiency of QLE-DS.

The idea is to bring every data source and control interface description related to a product or process available through a single interface, for auto-discovery and automated communication establishment. However, designing the architecture of a DT to serve every future application is an ambitious task. Therefore, the prototyping systems for specific applications are required to design the DT incrementally. We developed a novel DT prototype to analyze the requirements of communication in a mission-critical application such as mobile networks supported remote surgery. Such operations require low latency and high levels of security and reliability and therefore are a perfect subject for analyzing DT communication and cybersecurity. The system comprised of a robotic arm and HTC vive virtual reality (VR) system connected over a 4G mobile network. More than 70 test users were employed to assess the system. To address the cybersecurity of the system, we incorporated a network manipulation module to test the effect of network outages and attacks; we studied state of the art practices and their utilization within DTs. The capability of the system for actual remote surgery is limited by capabilities of the VR system and insufficient feedback from the robot. However, simulations and research of remote surgeries could be conducted with the system. As a result, we propose ideas for communication establishment and necessary cybersecurity technologies that will help in developing the DT architecture. Furthermore, we concluded that developing the DT requires cross-disciplinary development in several different engineering fields. Each field makes use of its own tools and methods, which do not always fit together perfectly.

The most spread is the data-driven, but the neurophysiology of emotions is rarely taken into account. Furthermore, commercial EEG devices usually do not provide electrodes purposefully chosen to assess emotions.

Virtual environments have the added benefit of being used to investigate the impact of different training approaches on competence. This pilot study uses decision tree modeling to examine the efficacy of two pedagogical approaches, simulation-based mastery learning (SBML) and lecture-based training (LBT), in a virtual environment. Decision trees are an inductive reasoning approach that can be used to identify learners’ egress strategies in offshore emergencies after training. The efficacy of the virtual training is evaluated in three ways: 1) analyzing participants’ performance scores in test scenarios; 2) comparing the decision tree depiction of participant's understanding of emergency egress to the intended learning objectives; and 3) comparing the decision strategies developed under a different pedagogical approach. A comparison of the resulting decision trees from the SBML training with trees generated from the LBT showed that the different training methods influenced the participants’ egress strategies. The SBML approach resulted in concise decision trees and better route selection strategies when compared to the LBT training. This pilot study demonstrates the diagnostic capabilities of decision trees as training assessment tools and recommends integrating decision trees into virtual training to better support the learning needs of individuals and deliver adaptive training scenarios.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2022.3207979","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Husky Energy Industrial Research Chair in Safety; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9895300","Decision making in emergencies;decision trees;enter simulation-based mastery learning (SBML);offshore emergency egress;training efficacy;virtual environments","Training;Decision trees;Safety;Virtual environments;Entropy;Data models;Industries","computer based training;decision trees;offshore installations;teaching;virtual reality","adaptive training scenarios;basic offshore safety protocols;decision tree modeling;decision trees;emergency egress;emergency evacuation;inductive reasoning approach;LBT training;offshore emergencies;offshore energy industry;pedagogical approach;pedagogical approaches;SBML training;simulation-based mastery;training assessment tools;virtual environment technology;virtual offshore egress training;virtual training","","","","27","CCBY","19 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the meantime, the volume of data generated at the edge networks is also increasing rapidly. Under this circumstance, building energy-efficient and privacy-protected communications is imperative for 5G and beyond wireless communication systems. The recent emerging distributed learning methods such as federated learning (FL) perform well in improving resource efficiency while protecting user privacy with low communication overhead. Specifically, FL enables edge devices to learn a shared network model by aggregating local updates while keeping all the training processes on local devices. This paper investigates distributed power allocation for edge users in decentralized wireless networks with aim to maximize energy/spectrum efficiency while preventing privacy leakage based on a FL framework. Due to the dynamics and complexity of wireless networks, we adopt an on-line Actor-Critic (AC) architecture as the local training model, and FL performs cooperation for edge users by sharing the gradients and weightages generated in the Actor network. Moreover, in order to resolve the over-fitting problem caused by data leakages in Non-independent and identically distributed (Non-i.i.d) data environment, we propose a federated augmentation mechanism with Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs) algorithm for data augmentation. Federated augmentation empowers each device to replenish the data buffer using a generative model of WGANs until accomplishing an i.i.d training dataset, which significantly reduces the communication overhead in distributed learning compared to direct data sample exchange method. Numerical results reveal that the proposed federated learning based cooperation and augmentation (FL-CA) algorithm possesses a good convergence property, high robustness and achieves better accuracy of power allocation strategy than other three benchmark algorithms.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2979323","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871099,61631005); Research and Development Program in Key Areas of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B010114001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9027899","Federated learning;power allocation;wireless networks;federated cooperation;federated augmentation","Resource management;Training;Wireless networks;Distributed databases;Data models;Machine learning algorithms;Performance evaluation","augmented reality;cloud computing;data privacy;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile radio;radio networks;resource allocation;wireless sensor networks","federated cooperation;decentralized wireless networks;mobile edge techniques;vehicle networking;computing resource consumptions;edge networks;privacy-protected communications;wireless communication systems;federated learning;resource efficiency;user privacy;low communication overhead;edge devices;shared network model;local updates;local devices;edge users;privacy leakage;FL framework;local training model;actor network;data leakages;data environment;federated augmentation mechanism;data augmentation;data buffer;direct data sample exchange method;power allocation strategy;Wasserstein generative adversarial network algorithm","","23","","47","CCBY","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, we present a hand-drawn sketch recognition scheme based on the ResNet convolutional neural network (CNN), which can strongly improve scenario interactiveness by allowing the user to conveniently add new furniture by means of free-hand drawing operations rather than tedious manual drag-and-pull operations. In addition, based on a deep Q-learning network (DQN), the best positions (states) for these pieces of furniture (agents) in virtual scenarios can be automatically determined, making it easy to satisfy popular design principles.

Hence, we propose an efficient time-domain multi-authority outsourcing attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme (TMO) with a dynamic policy updating method for secure data acquisition and sharing in the edge computing. Specifically, considering that the time is a crucial factor in many real-world application scenarios, we add time-domain information in the encryption algorithm. Besides, to take full advantage of edge computing, TMO extends the multi-authority ABE approach by outsourcing the computation to edge nodes to enhance security and performance. Moreover, to tackle the mobility and frequently changing edge environment, TMO also provides an efficient online policy updating method to manage attribute information and to access policy with low overhead. The security analysis and the experimental results show that TMO can indeed efficiently enhance data security with low overhead in the edge computing environment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2907319","Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LQ18F020003); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802093,61472109,61572163); Xi’an Key Laboratory of Mobile Edge Computing and Security(grant numbers:201805052-ZD3CG36); Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:2018C01098); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8673913","Multi-authority;CP-ABE;time-based;security;edge computing","Edge computing;Encryption;Outsourcing;Time-domain analysis;Cloud computing","authorisation;cloud computing;cryptography;data acquisition;data privacy;outsourcing","time-domain multiauthority outsourcing;massive privacy-sensitive user data;response time;data source;attribute-based encryption scheme;time domain;edge computing environment;data security;edge environment;edge nodes;time-domain information;secure data acquisition;TMO","","10","","37","IEEE","25 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The reason for this is the high computation speed and the huge storage capacity that cloud owners provide at low prices. However, despite the attractiveness of the cloud computing environment to database users, privacy issues remain a cause for concern for database owners since data access is out of their control. Encryption is the only way of assuaging users' fears surrounding data privacy, but executing Structured Query Language (SQL) queries over encrypted data is a challenging task, especially if the data are encrypted by a randomized encryption algorithm. Many researchers have addressed the privacy issues by encrypting the data using deterministic, onion layer, or homomorphic encryption. Nevertheless, even with these systems, the encrypted data can still be subjected to attack. In this research, we first propose an indexing scheme to encode the original table's tuples into bit vectors (BVs) prior to the encryption. The resulting index is then used to narrow the range of retrieved encrypted records from the cloud to a small set of records that are candidates for the user's query. Based on the indexing scheme, we then design a system to execute SQL queries over the encrypted data. The data are encrypted by a single randomized encryption algorithm, namely the Advanced Encryption Standard-Cipher-Block Chaining (AES-CBC). In the proposed scheme, we store the index values (BVs) at user's side, and we extend the system to support most of relational algebra operators, such as select, join, etc. Implementation and evaluation of the proposed system reveals that it is practical and efficient at reducing both the computation and space overhead when compared with state-of-the-art systems like CryptDB.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3082139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9437173","Cybersecurity;privacy-preserving;encrypted databases;SQL queries;cloud computing","Encryption;Cryptography;Databases;Cloud computing;Security;Data privacy;Companies","cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;database management systems;outsourcing;query processing;relational algebra;SQL","efficient secure system;fetching data;outsourced encrypted databases;database users;cloud database services;cloud owners;privacy issues;database owners;data access;data privacy;encrypted data;homomorphic encryption;indexing scheme;retrieved encrypted records;single randomized encryption algorithm;Advanced Encryption Standard-Cipher-Block Chaining","","2","","55","CCBY","20 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a special group of humans, cross-dressers are often very sensitive to their non-mainstream identities. Therefore, they are often confronted with more difficulties when using some modern information techniques such as Content-of-Interest (COI) search. Motivated by this fact, we introduce some advanced information retrieval and privacy protection techniques into the cross-dressing domain and further propose a privacy-aware COI search and recommendation solution for cross-dressers, named PCSR. First, PCSR uses fastText tool to transform the cross-dressers’ input keywords and the candidate webpages into corresponding vectors with less private content associated with cross-dressers. Afterwards, we use vector similarity calculation techniques to make privacy-preserving COI search and recommendation. At last, we validate the effectiveness of PCSR through a set of experiments.

Design/methodology/approach - The simulation environment is established by integrating virtual reality interface with a micro-simulation model. In the simulation, the vehicle autonomy is developed by a framework that integrates artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms. Human-subject experiments are carried, and participants are asked to virtually sit in the developed autonomous vehicle (AV) that allows for both human driving and autopilot functions within a mixed traffic environment. Findings - Not surprisingly, the inconsistency is identified between two driving modes, in which the AV's driving maneuver causes the cognitive bias and makes participants feel unsafe. Even though only a shallow portion of the cases that the AV ended up with an accident during the testing stage, participants still frequently intervened during the AV operation. On a similar note, even though the statistical results reflect that the AV drives under perceived high-risk conditions, rarely an actual crash can happen. This suggests that the classic safety surrogate measurement, e.g. time-to-collision, may require adjustment for the mixed traffic flow. Research limitations/implications - Understanding the behavior of AVs and the behavioral difference between AVs and human drivers are important, where the developed platform is only the first effort to identify the critical scenarios where the AVs might fail to react. Practical implications - This paper attempts to fill the existing research gap in preparing close-to-reality tools for AV experience and further understanding human behavior during high-level autonomous driving. Social implications - This work aims to systematically analyze the inconsistency in driving patterns between manual and autopilot modes in various driving scenarios (i.e. multiple scenes and various traffic conditions) to facilitate user acceptance of AV technology.

Accordingly, adaptive human-aware environments, sensitive to the daily human behavior and individual traits have to be provided, in order to offer a fully immersive and customized experience to users.

The paper applies the mixture density network to identify the perception model considering different senses, and then the multi-sensory integration is performed, accordingly to the actual neuro-cognitive model. Furthermore, a supervised learning module has been used to cluster the users on the basis of the human perception identification strategy previously designed, assuming a multimodal structure for the cognitive brain activity. Finally, a practical contextualization is presented, in relation to the haptics virtual reality services. What emerges from the results is the effectiveness of the tactful approach, i.e., brain-aware, involving the proposed framework, which is validated in comparison to the more conventional brain-agnostic scheme.

However, PCD can leak sensitive information about consumers' activities. Various privacy-preserving data collection schemes have been proposed for AMI networks to allow the collection of an aggregated PCD to preserve consumers' privacy. However, most of these schemes are designed for single-recipient AMI networks and cannot be used efficiently for multi-recipient AMI networks in which several entities should have access to the aggregated PCD of different sets of users for legitimate uses. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving data collection and access control scheme for multi-recipient AMI networks named EPDA. We developed a novel proxy re-encryption scheme that allows data aggregation before re-encryption and can allow either full or partial access to the aggregated data after re-encryption as needed. The proposed scheme can be used for fine-grained access control for multi-recipient AMI networks in which each recipient can access only the data intended to it. The EPDA uses lightweight operations in encryption, aggregation, and decryption which result in low computation and communication overheads. Our security analysis demonstrates that the EPDA is secure, can resist collusion attacks and hide customers' distribution which is needed for a fair electricity trade market. Our experimental results confirm that the EPDA has improved performance for the computational cost at each entity in the AMI network and low communication overhead.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2900934","Qatar Foundation(grant numbers:NPRP10-1223-160045); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8648329","Smart grid;AMI networks;privacy preservation;data aggregation;proxy re-encryption;fine-grained access control","Access control;Privacy;Data aggregation;Encryption;Data privacy","authorisation;cryptography;power consumption","real-time monitoring;energy management;proxy re-encryption scheme;lightweight operations;communication overheads;fair electricity trade market;fine-grained access control;data aggregation;EPDA;access control scheme;efficient privacy-preserving data collection;single-recipient AMI networks;aggregated PCD;privacy-preserving data collection schemes;fine-grained power consumption data;advanced metering infrastructure networks;multirecipient AMI networks","","18","","59","CCBY","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the strict network requirements of these remote services represent one of the major challenges that hinder their fast and large-scale deployment in critical infrastructures. This article addresses certain issues inherent in remote and immersive control of virtual reality (VR)-based unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), whereby a user remotely controls UAVs, equipped with 360° cameras, using their head-mounted devices (HMD) and their respective controllers. Remote and immersive control services, using 360° video streams, require much lower latency and higher throughput for true immersion and high service reliability. To assess and analyze these requirements, this article introduces a real-life testbed system that leverages different technologies (e.g., VR, 360° video streaming over 4G/5G, and edge computing). In the performance evaluation, different latency types are considered. They are namely: 1) glass-to-glass latency between the 360° camera of a remote UAV and the HMD display; 2) user/pilot’s reaction latency; and 3) the command/execution latency. The obtained results indicate that the responsiveness (dubbed Glass-to-Reaction-to-Execution—GRE–latency) of a pilot, using our system, to a sudden event is within an acceptable range, i.e., around 900 ms.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3222282","European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme through CHARITY Project(grant numbers:101016509); Academy of Finland 6Genesis Project(grant numbers:318927); Idea-Mill(grant numbers:33593); Technology Innovation Program; Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE), South Korea(grant numbers:RS-2022-00154678); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9951155","5G and beyond;edge computing;immersive services;mobile networking;unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV);virtual reality (VR)","Streaming media;Cameras;Reliability;Delays;5G mobile communication;Internet of Things;Autonomous aerial vehicles","","","","1","","82","CCBY","15 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The application of association rule mining in healthcare data has been widespread to this point in time. Most applications focus on positive association rules, ignoring the negative consequences of particular diagnostic techniques. When it comes to bridging divergent diseases and drugs, negative association rules may give more helpful information than positive ones. This is especially true when it comes to physicians and social organizations (e.g., a certain symptom will not arise when certain symptoms exist). Data mining in healthcare must be done in a way that protects the identity of patients, especially when dealing with sensitive information. However, revealing this information puts it at risk of attack. Healthcare data privacy protection has lately been addressed by technologies that disrupt data (data sanitization) and reconstruct aggregate distributions in the interest of doing research in data mining. In this study, metaheuristic-based data sanitization for healthcare data mining is investigated in order to keep patient privacy protected. It is hoped that by using the Tabu-genetic algorithm as an optimization tool, the suggested technique chooses item sets to be sanitized (modified) from transactions that satisfy sensitive negative criteria with the goal of minimizing changes to the original database. Experiments with benchmark healthcare datasets show that the suggested privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) method outperforms existing algorithms in terms of Hiding Failure (HF), Artificial Rule Generation (AR), and Lost Rules (LR).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3192447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9832893","Privacy-preserving data mining;healthcare data;evolutionary computation;sanitization process","Medical services;Data privacy;Genetic algorithms;Databases;Optimization;Data integrity;Task analysis","data mining;data privacy;diseases;genetic algorithms;health care;medical information systems;search problems","privacy preserving data mining framework;negative association rules;healthcare informatics;healthcare information;data custodians;association rule mining;positive association rules;negative consequences;helpful information;sensitive information;healthcare data privacy protection;metaheuristic-based data sanitization;healthcare data mining;patient privacy;sensitive negative criteria;benchmark healthcare datasets;suggested privacy;Artificial Rule Generation;Lost Rules","","1","","64","CCBY","19 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, integrating satellite and terrestrial networks makes the system more vulnerable to spoofing attacks. Thus, robust and effective authentication is required. Physical layer authentication (PLA) has emerged as an alternative paradigm that uses physical characteristics to achieve authentication. In this paper, PLA is proposed for low earth orbit (LEO) satellites using the Doppler frequency shift (DS) and received power (RP) characteristics. Hypothesis testing using a threshold or machine learning (ML) is considered to discriminate between legitimate and illegitimate satellites. For ML, a one-class classification support vector machine (OCC-SVM) is employed which uses training data from only legitimate users. The performance is evaluated using real satellite data from the system tool kit (STK). Results are presented which show that the authentication rate (AR) with DS is higher than with RP at low elevation angles for both schemes, but is higher with RP at high elevation angles. Further, the ML authentication scheme provides a higher AR than the threshold scheme for a small percentage of the training data considered as outliers, but at larger percentages the OR threshold scheme is better.","2644-1330","","10.1109/OJVT.2022.3218609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9966329","Doppler frequency shift;physical layer authentication;received power;vertical heterogeneous network;space network;machine learning","Satellites;Authentication;Training data;Low earth orbit satellites;Programmable logic arrays;Machine learning;Physical layer","artificial satellites;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;satellite communication;support vector machines;telecommunication security","authentication rate;Doppler frequency shift;elevation angles;hypothesis testing;legitimate satellites;legitimate users;low earth orbit;machine learning;ML authentication scheme;one-class classification support vector machine;physical characteristics;physical layer authentication;PLA;power characteristics;received power;RP;satellite communication networks;satellite data;spoofing attacks;stability;system tool kit;terrestrial networks;threshold scheme;training data","","3","","50","CCBY","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Initialization is always crucial to bootstrap the monocular SLAM system. With the rapid growth of some quick-start required SLAM applications, e.g., augmented reality (AR) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), devising faster and more accurate initialization has become a central problem. Traditional initialization uses the first two frames to create landmarks and then computes camera poses for the subsequential frames, using a 3D-to-2D perspective-n-points (PnP) mechanism. In this paper, we propose a novel three-frame-only (3FO) initialization approach for the monocular SLAM system, which consists of two steps. In the first step, we use the first two frames to preinitialize poses and landmarks, and in the second step, we use the second and third frames to improve the preinitialization by using the scale consistency of the landmarks generated in the first step to filter out outliers and using inliers to generate more robust landmarks. In both steps, we use the pretrained multilayer perceptron (MLP) combined with homotopy continuation to solve the essential matrices. Finally, we perform a global bundle adjustment (BA) to refine the three camera poses and all the created landmarks. The proposed 3FO initialization approach is evaluated experimentally on the EuRoC benchmark data set with the initialization time and trajectory metrics. The results show that, compared to the traditional ORB-SLAM2 initialization, the 3FO approach reduces the initialization time by 5 times and improves the accuracy by 36.7% on average.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3213684","National Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:61862011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9915573","SLAM;multilayer perceptron (MLP);homotopy continuation;monocular;initialization","Simultaneous localization and mapping;Cameras;Matrix decomposition;Visualization;Feature extraction;Real-time systems;Optical filters;Augmented reality;Autonomous aerial vehicles","augmented reality;autonomous aerial vehicles;cameras;multilayer perceptrons;pose estimation;robot vision;SLAM (robots)","3FO approach;traditional ORB-SLAM2 initialization;initialization time;3FO initialization approach;created landmarks;robust landmarks;three-frame-only initialization approach;3D-to-2D perspective-n-points mechanism;subsequential frames;camera poses;traditional initialization;accurate initialization;monocular SLAM system;easy calibration;monocular simultaneous localization;accurate monocular SLAM initialization;three-frame-only approach","","","","31","CCBY","10 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As one typical metaverse application, platooning control of vehicular cyber–physical systems has attracted extensive attention as it is beneficial to improve traffic efficiency, driving safety, and emission reduction. However, due to the open nature of wireless communication networks, the transmitted vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) data packets become exposed to the public and concomitant data leakage can lead to unintended consequences to vehicular platoons. This article is concerned with the privacy-preserving platooning control issue of vehicular cyber–physical systems with input saturations. First, a novel distributed proportional-integral observer is proposed to estimate the full state of each vehicle, where the integral terms with a forgetting factor facilitate to realize the tradeoff between transient performance and steady-state performance for the platoon. Second, sampled-data-based dynamic encryption and decryption schemes, featuring a dynamic private key, are developed such that the encrypted and decrypted V2V data can be kept private to each platoon vehicle. It is then shown that the platooning control problem over a generic communication topology can be cast into the stability issue of an auxiliary dynamic system. Furthermore, sufficient conditions on the existence of the desired observer and controller gains as well as the private key parameter selection are derived to guarantee the desired platoon stability and privacy preservation requirements. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2022.3226901","Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher Award(grant numbers:DE200101128); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9991185","Encryption and decryption;platooning control;privacy preservation;proportional-integral observers (PIOs);vehicular cyber–physical systems","Vehicle dynamics;Data privacy;Observers;Topology;Privacy;Metaverse;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","","","","1","","50","CCBY","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A critical issue in T1D patients is the managing of Postprandial Glucose Response (PGR), through the dosing of the insulin bolus to inject before meals. The Artificial Pancreas (AP), combining autonomous insulin delivery and blood glucose monitoring, is a promising solution. However, state-of-the-art APs require several information for bolus delivery, such as the estimated carbohydrate intake over the meals. This is mainly related to the limited knowledge of the determinants of PGR. Although meal carbohydrates are mostly considered as the major factor into, uencing PGR, other food components play a relevant role in PGRs, and thus, should be taken into account. Based on these considerations, a study to determine the effect of nutritional factors (i.e., carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, fibers, and energy intake) in the short and middle term on Blood Glucose Levels (BGLs) prediction was conducted by Machine Learning (ML) methods. A ML model able to predict the BGLs after 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes from the meal leveraging on insulin doses, blood glucose, and nutritional factors in T1D patients on AP systems was implemented. More specifically, to investigate the impact of the nutritional factors on the model predictions, a Feed-Forward Neural Network, was fed with several dispositions of BGLs, insulin, and nutritional factors.

In this study, three robust feature extraction methods, Time-domain (TD) feature, Frequency Division Technique (FDT), and Autoregressive (AR) feature, and their combinations were investigated while the number of channels varying from one to eight. For these system parameters, the performance of sixteen static wrist and hand gestures was systematically investigated in two authentication modes: verification and identification.

For an identification system, the average Rank-1 error (R1E) for a four-channel configuration was 3% for TD features, 12.4% for FDT features, and 36.3% for AR features. The electrode position on the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) muscle had a critical contribution to the authentication performance. Thus, the combination of the TD feature set and a four-channel sEMG system with one of the electrodes positioned on the FCU are recommended for optimal authentication performance.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2021.3079428","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(grant numbers:072169); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9429208","Biometrics;gesture recognition;surface electromyogram (sEMG);feature extraction;electrode configuration;user verification;user identification","Biometrics (access control);Authentication;Feature extraction;Electrodes;Thumb;Gesture recognition;Time-domain analysis","autoregressive processes;biomedical electrodes;biometrics (access control);electromyography;feature extraction;medical signal processing;time-domain analysis","feature extraction;time-domain feature;frequency division technique;autoregressive feature;hand gestures;average equal error rate;four-channel sEMG verification system;TD features;FDT features;AR features;identification system;four-channel configuration;biometric authentication;sEMG-based biometric system;static wrist gestures;average rank-1 error;surface electromyography based biometric sensing system;electrodes;flexor carpi ulnaris muscle","","8","","48","CCBYNCND","12 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A security collaboration model involving coupled state vectors associated with topology control and time synchronization is proposed. The networks achieve synchronization using weights and by controlling the number of goals. The simple calculation of time synchronization values between neighboring nodes serves as the basis for judging the behavior of the node topology control. The coupling state vector calculation is the core of the model. The topology coupling strength rate, signal intensity reduction, clock drift, and clock delay are combined to form a comprehensive model. The network energy consumption is reduced by updating the coupling state vector regularly. The coupling cooperation threshold is set to make security decisions and effectively distinguish between attack nodes and dead nodes. Thus, to ensure the security and reliability of the network, we present a security cooperation collection tree protocol (SC-CTP) scheme that maintains a trusted environment and isolates misbehaving nodes. The simulation results show that the model can detect malicious nodes effectively, has a high detection rate, and greatly reduces the energy consumption of the whole network. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, a large-scale wireless sensor network with 200 nodes was deployed on a campus. The proposed model was applied to optimize the deployment of key nodes on the campus. Furthermore, a candidate set of these nodes were selected to achieve coupling cooperation of key goals. This test verified the reliability of the model, its customizable accuracy, and the reliability of the control.","1976-5541","","10.1109/JCN.2019.000041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8796507","Security cooperation model;time synchronization;topology control;WSNs","Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks;Topology;Network topology;Reliability;Security;Energy consumption","protocols;synchronisation;telecommunication control;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;vectors;wireless sensor networks","security cooperation model;wireless sensor networks;malicious attacks;uncoordinated behavior;trustless control;security collaboration model;time synchronization values;node topology control;coupling state vector calculation;topology coupling strength rate;signal intensity reduction;clock delay;network energy consumption;coupling cooperation threshold;security cooperation collection tree protocol scheme;WSN;SC-CTP scheme","","6","","","","13 Aug 2019","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

Therefore, it is necessary to consider the quality of the delivery of physical effects to users by IoT devices for selecting services in IoT environments. However, traditional service-selection algorithms focus primarily on the network-level Quality of Service (QoS), such as latency and throughput. In this study, we improve on the visual-service effectiveness metric developed in our previous work to measure the effectiveness of the personalized delivery of physical effects of visual services to users by considering user- and application-specific factors. We evaluate the metric by conducting a user study, and the results show that the metric reflects users’ perceived effectiveness with high accuracy. We also investigate the use of virtual reality (VR) to imitate physical environments for efficient evaluation of the metric. Based on this metric, we develop a dynamic effect-driven output-service selection agent (DEOSA) that selects output services dynamically by considering the effectiveness of service-effect delivery. By adopting a state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning algorithm, DEOSA can learn the optimal policy for selecting output services that can be generalized to various environments. We evaluate DEOSA in simulated IoT environments and show that it can learn the optimal policy successfully; it generally performs better than traditional greedy algorithms in terms of the visual service effectiveness metric and the replacement overhead in randomly generated test environments.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3211270","Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea; Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) Support Program supervised by the Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP)(grant numbers:IITP-2022-2020-0-01795); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Korea Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2019R1A2C1087430); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9908162","Effect-driven service selection;Internet of Things (IoT);reinforcement learning;virtual reality (VR);visual-service effectiveness","Internet of Things;Measurement;Visualization;Heuristic algorithms;Reinforcement learning;Quality of service;Handover","computer network security;deep learning (artificial intelligence);greedy algorithms;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);quality of service;reinforcement learning;resource allocation;virtual reality","deep reinforcement learning;dynamic effect-driven output-service selection agent;human users;IoT devices;IoT-based services;output services;physical effects;physical environments;service-effect delivery;simulated IoT environments;state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning algorithm;traditional service-selection algorithms;visual service effectiveness metric;visual services;visual-service effectiveness metric","","","","47","CCBY","3 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We overcome these challenges by creating “The Virtual Caliper”, which uses VR game controllers to make simple measurements. First, we establish what body measurements users can reliably make on their own body. We find several distance measurements to be good candidates and then verify that these are linearly related to 3D body shape as represented by the SMPL body model. The Virtual Caliper enables novice users to accurately measure themselves and create an avatar with their own body shape. We evaluate the metric accuracy relative to ground truth 3D body scan data, compare the method quantitatively to other avatar creation tools, and perform extensive perceptual studies. We also provide a software application to the community that enables novices to rapidly create avatars in fewer than five minutes.

NoC paradigm is based on the idea of resource sharing in which hardware resources, including buffers, communication links, routers, etc., are shared between all IPs of the MPSoC. In fact, the data being routed by each NoC router might not be related to the router's local core. Such a utilization-centric design approach can raise security issues in NoC-based designs, e.g., integrity and confidentiality of the data being routed in an NoC might be compromised by unauthorized accesses/modifications of intermediate routers.

In the view synthesis techniques, depth-image-based rendering (DIBR) is an important method to generate virtual view from video-plus-depth sequence. However, some holes might be produced in the DIBR process. Many hole filling methods have been proposed to tackle this issue, but most of them cannot achieve globally coherent or acquire trusted contents. In this paper, a hole filling method with depthguided global optimization is proposed for view synthesis. The global optimization is achieved by iterating the spatio-temporal approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search and video reconstruction step. Directly applying global optimization might introduce some foreground artifacts to the synthesized video. To prevent this problem, some strategies have been developed in this paper. The depth information is applied to guide the spatio-temporal ANN searching and the initialization step is specified in the global optimization procedure.

In this environment, threats from authorized insiders are of particular concerns. Based on an extreme case of distributed computation where multiple collaborators jointly perform CBDC on shared datasets using an example distributed computing framework, MapReduce (MR), deployed in a Multiple Public Cloud (MPC) environment, this paper investigates how to protect the authenticity of data used during the computation in an efficient and scalable manner by proposing and evaluating a novel data authentication solution. The solution, called a Communication Pattern based Data Authentication (CPDA) framework, ensures data authenticity and non-repudiation of origin at the finest granularity without compromising efficiency and scalability. This is achieved by using an idea of communication pattern based authentication data aggregation. The framework has been comprehensively evaluated both theoretically and experimentally. The evaluation results show that the CPDA framework offers the strongest level of data authenticity protection (equivalent to that provided by digitally signing each data object individually) but introduces much lower overhead cost than the digital signature based solution.

Consequently, in these IoT applications, biometric verification needs to be carried out in the scrambled domain, presenting significant challenges in face recognition. Since face models become chaotic signals after scrambling/encryption, a typical solution is to utilize the traditional data-driven face recognition algorithms. While chaotic pattern recognition is still a challenging task, in this paper, we propose a new ensemble approach-many-kernel random discriminant analysis (MK-RDA)-to discover discriminative patterns from the chaotic signals. We also incorporate a salience-aware strategy into the proposed ensemble method to handle the chaotic facial patterns in the scrambled domain, where the random selections of features are made on semantic components via salience modeling. In our experiments, the proposed MK-RDA was tested rigorously on three human face data sets: the ORL face data set, the PIE face data set, and the PUBFIG wild face data set. The experimental results successfully demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively handle the chaotic signals and significantly improve the recognition accuracy, making our method a promising candidate for secure biometric verification in the emerging IoT applications.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2016.2555792","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7456303","Facial biometrics;face scrambling;many manifolds;many kernels;random discriminant analysis;mobile biometrics;Internet-of-Things;user privacy;Facial biometrics;face scrambling;many manifolds;many kernels;random discriminant analysis;mobile biometrics;Internet-of-things;user privacy","Face;Semantics;Face recognition;Transforms;Encryption;Kernel;Privacy","cryptography;data protection;face recognition;feature extraction;image watermarking;Internet of Things;statistical analysis","salience-aware ensembles;Internet-of-Things;face scrambling;privacy protection;IoT-targeted image-video distribution;biometric verification;face models;data-driven face recognition algorithms;chaotic pattern recognition;many-kernel random discriminant analysis;salience-aware strategy;random feature selections;MK-RDA;human face data sets;ORL face data set;PIE face data set;PUBFIG wild face data set","","25","","42","CCBY","21 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, these methods only concerned the identification in either spatial or temporal domain, and may get irrelevant contents from another domain. These irrelevant contents are usually undesirable in the training phase, which will lead to a degradation of the detection performance. This paper advances prior work by proposing a joint learning framework to simultaneously identify the spatial and temporal extents of the action of interest in training videos. To get pixel-level localization results, our method uses dense trajectories extracted from videos as local features to represent actions. We first present a trajectory split-and-merge algorithm to segment a video into the background and several separated foreground moving objects. In this algorithm, the inherent temporal smoothness of human actions is exploited to facilitate segmentation. Then, with the latent SVM framework on segmentation results, spatial and temporal extents of the action of interest are treated as latent variables that are inferred simultaneously with action recognition.

In this article, to mitigate the inconsistency between dimensionality reduction and feature retention in imbalanced IBD, we propose a variational long short-term memory (VLSTM) learning model for intelligent anomaly detection based on reconstructed feature representation. An encoder-decoder neural network associated with a variational reparameterization scheme is designed to learn the low-dimensional feature representation from high-dimensional raw data. Three loss functions are defined and quantified to constrain the reconstructed hidden variable into a more explicit and meaningful form. A lightweight estimation network is then fed with the refined feature representation to identify anomalies in IBD. Experiments using a public IBD dataset named UNSW-NB15 demonstrate that the proposed VLSTM model can efficiently cope with imbalance and high-dimensional issues, and significantly improve the accuracy and reduce the false rate in anomaly detection for IBD according to F1, area under curve (AUC), and false alarm rate (FAR).","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2020.3022432","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFE0117500); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2019JJ40150); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61702183); Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Department(grant numbers:2019GK2131); Key Project of Hunan Provincial Education Department(grant numbers:17A113); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9195000","Anomaly detection;feature representation;industrial big data (IBD);long short-term memory (LSTM);variational Bayes","Anomaly detection;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Dimensionality reduction;Neural networks;Estimation","Big Data;learning (artificial intelligence);production engineering computing;recurrent neural nets;security of data","encoder-decoder neural network;variational reparameterization scheme;low-dimensional feature representation;high-dimensional raw data;public IBD dataset;variational LSTM enhanced anomaly detection;industrial big data;digital industry field;intelligent industry field;data stream;high-dimensional anomaly detection;intelligent industrial application;dimensionality reduction;feature retention;imbalanced IBD;intelligent anomaly detection;reconstructed feature representation;variational long short-term memory learning model","","145","","27","CCBY","11 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main goal of those technologies is to support a wide range of new applications, such as virtual reality, metaverse, telehealth, online education, autonomous and flying vehicles, smart cities, smart grids, advanced manufacturing, and many more. The key motivation of NextG networks is to meet the high demand for those applications by improving and optimizing network functions.

However, the security concerns on network functions of NextG using AI-based models, i.e., model poisoning, have not been investigated deeply. It is crucial to protect the next-generation cellular networks against cybersecurity threats, especially adversarial attacks. Therefore, it needs to design efficient mitigation techniques and secure solutions for NextG networks using AI-based methods. This paper proposes a comprehensive vulnerability analysis of deep learning (DL)-based channel estimation models trained with the dataset obtained from MATLAB’s 5G toolbox for adversarial attacks and defensive distillation-based mitigation methods. The adversarial attacks produce faulty results by manipulating trained DL-based models for channel estimation in NextG networks while mitigation methods can make models more robust against adversarial attacks.

To the best of our knowledge, almost all existing studies lack the integration of domain expert knowledge, which limits their performance. In this study, we focused on incorporating domain expert knowledge into the FCN estimation from a modularity perspective. To achieve this, we presented a human-guided modular representation (MR) FCN estimation framework. Specifically, we designed an adversarial low-rank constraint to describe the module structure of FCNs under the guidance of domain expert knowledge (i.e., a predefined participant index).

Remarkably, MR significantly outperformed the baseline and state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods, achieving an accuracy of 92.11%.

Prostate cancer lesions have the characteristics of small size and blurry outline, which is a challenge to design a robust prostate cancer detection method. At present, clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer is mainly based on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, it is difficult to obtain prostate cancer data, and the data with true values is also very limited, which further increases the difficulty of prostate cancer detection methods based on MR images. To solve these problems, this paper designs a new method of prostate cancer detection based on MR images, which is recorded as ProCDet. The method consists of three modules: registration of prostate MR images, segmentation of prostate, and segmentation of prostate cancer lesions. First, the registration between different sequences of MR images is performed to find the spatial relationship between the different sequences. Then, the designed prostate segmentation network based on the attention mechanism is used to segment the prostate to remove the interference of background information. Finally, a 3D prostate cancer lesion segmentation network based on Focal Tversky Loss is applied to determine the specific location of prostate cancer.

Despite the practical advantage, the typical network lacks control over the feature distribution causing the network to be more prone to noisy information and occasional poor prediction performance. We propose a novel projection loss as a regularizing objective to improve the time-to-event Deepsurv model. The loss formulation maximizes the lower bound of the multiple-correlation coefficient between the network’s features and the desired hazard value. Reducing the loss also theoretically lowers the upper bound on the likelihood of discordant pair and improves C-index performance.

The conventional approach to achieve voltage control based on offline simulation for voltage set point calculation does not consider forecast errors. In this work, a stochastic optimal voltage control strategy is proposed while considering load and irradiance forecast errors. Stochastic operational risks such as overvoltage and VR runaway are defined through a chance constrained optimization (CCO) problem. This classical formulation to mitigate runaway is further improved by introducing a stochastic index called the Tap Tail Expectation. Operational objectives such as power losses and excessive tap count minimization are considered in the formulation. A sampling approach is proposed to solve the CCO. Along with other voltage control devices, the PV inverter voltage support features are coordinated. The simulation study is performed using a realistic distribution system model and practically measured irradiance to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

In our study, (1) first, an experiment is conducted based on a real-world campus dataset of college students ( $N =156$ ) that aggregates multisource behavioral data covering not only online and offline learning but also behaviors inside and outside of the classroom. Specifically, to gain in-depth insight into the features leading to excellent or poor performance, metrics measuring the linear and nonlinear behavioral changes (e.g., regularity and stability) of campus lifestyles are estimated; furthermore, features representing dynamic changes in temporal lifestyle patterns are extracted by the means of long short-term memory (LSTM).

To address the spectral efficiency concern, this article reviews—with a scope limited to prototyped systems—some of the existing works in the literature that pertain to increasing the spectral efficiency of backscatter systems. The prototyped systems can be grouped—based on the implementation technique used—into three groups: High-order modulation, single-sideband modulation, and pulse shaping.

In the request provisioning, the starting time of requests is considered and the earlier transmitted requests have higher resource selection priority. Next, the spectrum blocks with minimal resource spacing between adjacent requests (RS-AR) are planned for requests to maximize the free resources of the network in the resource planning. In addition, for the new request that would be blocked, passive adjustment begins. After planning reserved resources for the new request, conflicting AR requests are re-provisioned. Finally, the active adjustment re-optimizes the resources by increasing the tightness of spectrum resources. Simulation results show that the proposed RA-CPP scheme has greater advantages in blocking probability and spectrum utilization compared with the benchmark schemes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3127317","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61905060); Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province(grant numbers:F2019402240,F2018402198); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9611289","Advanced reservation (AR);blocking probability;complete planning process;elastic optical networks (EONs);immediate reservation (IR);space division multiplexing (SDM)","Resource management;Planning;Optical fiber networks;WDM networks;Routing;Optimization;Quality of service","optical crosstalk;optical fibre networks;probability;resource allocation;space division multiplexing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic;wavelength assignment","complete planning process;SDM-EONs;request provisioning;resource planning;passive adjustment;active adjustment;earlier transmitted requests;higher resource selection priority;minimal resource spacing;adjacent requests;free resources;reserved resources;AR requests;spectrum resources;RA-CPP scheme;resource allocation scheme;immediate advance reservation;advanced reservation;future space division multiplexing-elastic","","","","40","CCBY","10 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This will allow a range of modern urban reasoning applications that require reduced latency and jitter such as remote surgery, vehicle collision detection and augmented reality. The traffic flow from IoT devices to the cloud will also be reduced as with the increased accuracy from deep learning models only a subset of the data will need to be reported after a first pass analysis. However, the training time of deep learning models can be long, taking weeks on multiple desktop GPUs for large datasets. In this paper we show how transfer learning can be used to update the last layers of pre-trained models at the edge of the network, dramatically reducing the training time and allowing the model to perform new tasks without data ever having to be sent to the cloud.

This novel estimator of PSV is denoted as the maximum likelihood phase space volume (ML-PSV). The Cramér Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of the ML-PSV estimator has also been derived. We have shown that the mean square error of the ML-PSV estimate gradually approaches its CRLB asymptotically. An algorithm is formulated that applies the ML-PSV estimator as an objective function in the task of blind system identification of autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) models. The proposed technique is shown to improve blind identification performance at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the system is driven by both chaotic numeric and symbolic signals. The efficiency of our proposed method is compared with conventional blind identification methods through simulations.

However, owing to the limited computational and communication resources of PEC systems, it is necessary to design a novel resource management algorithm. In this study, we adopt cooperative bargaining theory to design our PEC resource allocation scheme. According to the concept of unification bargaining solution, different bargaining ideas are reciprocally combined to provide a fair-efficient solution. By coordinating network agents, we can leverage mutual consensus and approximate a well-balanced system performance among conflicting requirements.

This problem is known as Low-Resolution Person re-identification (LR PREID). An efficient strategy would be to exploit image super-resolution (SR) with person re-identification as a mutual learning approach. In this paper, we propose a novel method MSA-SR-PREID to solve this problem. The model takes low-resolution images on different resolutions and resized them to pre-defined fixed resolution. The design of the super-resolution network consists of ESRGAN and the de-Noising module to generate super-resolution images. The SR images are later passed to the re-identification network to learn the unique descriptors to recognize a person identity. The performance of this model is evaluated on four competitive benchmarks, MLR-VIPeR, MLR-DukeMTMC-reID, VR-MSMT17, and VR-Market1501.

In this paper, we focus on MapReduce, a popular big data computing framework, and propose the runtime integrity audition (RIA), a solution that remotely verifies the runtime integrity of MapReduce applications. RIA records the runtime variable values of the MapReduce application on the public cloud and checks those values against the application's code on the private cloud. By doing so, RIA protects the runtime integrity of MapReduce applications. Based on the idea of RIA, we developed a prototype system, called MR Auditor, and tested its applicability and performance with several Hadoop applications. Our experimental results showed that MR Auditor is a general tool that can efficiently audit the runtime integrity of all the MapReduce applications that we tested. In addition, MR Auditor incurs a moderate performance overhead. For example, when verifying the Word Count application, a proper parameter setting of MR Auditor incurs 1% of extra execution time on the public cloud and 14% of extra execution time on the private cloud.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2017.2787993","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602364); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2017JM6083); Open Fund of the Chinese Key Laboratory of the Grain Information Processing and Control(grant numbers:KFJJ-2015-202); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61373173,U1536202,61602365); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8241805","Runtime integrity;remote verification;cloud computing;mapreduce","Cloud computing;Runtime;Security;Computational modeling;Big Data;Computer science","auditing;Big Data;cloud computing;formal verification;parallel processing;security of data","practical verifiable computation;public cloud vendors;runtime integrity audition;RIA;MapReduce application;runtime variable values;private cloud;Hadoop applications;MR Auditor;Word Count application;Big Data computing services","","5","","44","OAPA","29 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These verticals have a diverse set of network connectivity requirements, and it is challenging to deliver customized services for each by using a common 5G infrastructure. Thus, the operation of Local 5G operator (L5GO) networks or private 5G networks are a viable option to tackle this challenge. A L5GO network is a localized small cell network which can offer tailored service delivery. The adaptation of network softwarization in 5G allows vertical owners to deploy and operate L5GO networks. However, the deployment of L5GOs raises various issues related to management of subscribers, roaming users, spectrum, security, and also the infrastructure. This paper proposes a blockchain-based platform to address these issues. The paper introduces a set of blockchain-based modularized functions such as service rating systems, bidding techniques, and selection functions, which can be used to deploy different services for L5GOs.

The uncertainties, initiated by the time-series behavior of renewables, will almost certainly lead to bad TI results without a proper treatment. These uncertainties are analytically intractable under conventional framework-they are usually jointly spatial-temporal dependent, and hence cannot be simply treated as white noise. For this purpose, a hybrid framework is suggested in this paper to handle these uncertainties in a systematic and theoretical way; in particular, big data analytics are studied to harness the jointly spatial-temporal statistical properties of those uncertainties. With some prior knowledge, a model bank is built first to store the countable typical models of network configurations; therefore, the difference between the SE outputs of each bank model and our observation is capable of being defined as a matrix variate-the so-called random matrix. In order to gain insight into the random matrix, a well-designed metric space is needed. Auto-regression (AR) model, factor analysis (FA), and random matrix theory (RMT) are tied together for the metric space design, followed by jointly temporal-spatial analysis of those matrices which is conducted in a high-dimensional (vector) space. Under the proposed framework, some big data analytics and theoretical results are obtained to improve the TI performance. Our framework is validated using IEEE standard distribution network with some field data in practice.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2020.3024955","National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research(grant numbers:2016YFB0901300); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51907121,U1866206); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9200525","Topology identification;renewables;uncertainty;random matrix theory;AR model;factor analysis;high dimension","Uncertainty;Analytical models;Big Data;Data models;Matrix converters;Task analysis;Power systems","Big Data;data analysis;matrix algebra;random processes;statistical analysis;statistical distributions;time series;white noise","topology identification;distribution grid;renewables integration;state estimation;high-penetration;bad TI results;white noise;big data analytics;spatial-temporal statistical properties;countable typical models;network configurations;SE outputs;bank model;matrix variate;auto-regression model;random matrix theory;metric space design;temporal-spatial analysis;high-dimensional space;TI performance;IEEE standard distribution network","","11","","36","CCBYNCND","18 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These OD flow could give us a great opportunity to research geographical phenomena such as spatial interaction and mobility patterns. The OD flow clustering approach is an effective way to explore the main mobility patterns of the objects. At the same time, similarity measurement plays a key role in OD flow clustering. However, most of the previous OD flow similarity measurement methods failed to make full use of the spatial information of the flow including spatial proximity and geometric similarity. In this paper, we considered both position information and geometric properties of OD flow and propose a new method to measure the spatial similarity between OD flows. Specifically, the proposed method sets the neighbor threshold with the length of OD flows and the parameter  $\alpha $  dynamically. Based on the constraint of the OD points’ location, the directions of the flows are implicitly restricted. The sole-parameter  $\alpha $  has a practical value as it determines the maximum length difference and the maximum directional difference that can be tolerated between similar flows. The proposed method passed a simulation experiment with synthetic flows and a case study with 283,008 taxi trips in Beijing in one day. The results show that the proposed method can discover the dominant mobility pattern from a large number of flow data effectively. In the case study, the dominant flow clusters reveal the taxi mobility patterns of residents at different distances in Beijing.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3040852","National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42071376); Open Project Program of the State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems, Beihang University(grant numbers:01119220010011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272289","Mobility pattern;origin-destination flow;spatial similarity;spatial clustering","Length measurement;Clustering methods;Load modeling;Density measurement;Trajectory;Time factors","computational geometry;feature extraction;mobile computing;pattern clustering;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","mobility patterns;OD flow similarity measurement;OD flow clustering;spatial flow clustering;mobile positioning technology;origin destination flow data;origin destination points;spatial proximity;geometric similarity;geometric properties;taxi trips;Beijing;traffic flow extraction","","1","","35","CCBYNCND","26 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

MRI is a powerful medical imaging modality, but it shows severe limitations when dealing with motion at high spatial and temporal resolutions. In this work, a method called spectro-dynamic MRI is proposed, which can identify dynamical information directly from k-space data. It combines a measurement model, relating the measured data in k-space to the displacement fields, and a dynamical model, introducing prior knowledge about the dynamics of a system. The data sampling process is tailored to compute spatial and temporal derivatives in the spectral domain at a high temporal resolution. Preliminary results from four simple pendulum setups for which the dynamics are explicitly known show that spectro-dynamic MRI can estimate motion fields from heavily undersampled data on a millisecond timescale. Furthermore, the length of the pendula and the stiffness of the spring can be identified as the dynamical system’s parameters, giving additional information about the systems under investigation.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3138631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9663189","Dynamic imaging;dynamical system identification;magnetic resonance imaging;spectro-dynamic MRI","Magnetic resonance imaging;Image reconstruction;Data models;Spectral analysis;Dynamical systems;Displacement measurement","biomedical MRI;diseases;image reconstruction;medical image processing;motion estimation;pendulums","temporal derivatives;high temporal resolution;spectro-dynamic MRI;dynamical system;characterizing mechanical systems;vivo dynamics;musculoskeletal system;powerful medical imaging modality;high spatial resolutions;temporal resolutions;dynamical information;k-space data;measurement model;dynamical model;spatial derivatives","","","","42","CCBYNCND","24 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we present a methodology for identifying and registering partially-scanned and noisy 3D objects, lying in arbitrary positions in a 3D scene, with corresponding high-quality models. The methodology is assessed on point cloud scenes with multiple objects with large missing parts. The proposed approach does not require connectivity information and is thus generic and computationally efficient, thereby facilitating computationally demanding applications, like augmented reality. The main contributions of this work are the introduction of a layered joint registration and indexing scheme of cluttered partial point clouds using a novel multi-scale saliency extraction technique to identify distinctive regions, and an enhanced similarity criterion for object-to-model matching.

Identifying emotions in spontaneous speech is a novel and challenging subject of research.

The proposed study introduces a novel technique for recognizing semi-natural and spontaneous speech emotions based on 1D (Model A) and 2D (Model B) deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) with two layers of long-short-term memory (LSTM). Both models used raw speech data and augmented (mid, left, right, and side) segment level Mel spectrograms to learn local and global features. The architecture of both models consists of five local feature learning blocks (LFLBs), two LSTM layers, and a fully connected layer (FCL). In addition to learning local correlations and extracting hierarchical correlations, LFLB comprises two convolutional layers and a max-pooling layer. The LSTM layer learns long-term correlations from local features. The experiments illustrated that the proposed systems perform better than conventional methods.

NDNs are ideal for hosting content-centric next-generation applications such as Internet of things (IoT) and virtual reality. Intent-driven management is poised to enhance the performance of the offered NDN services to these applications while reducing its management complexity. This article proposes I2DN, intent-driven NDN, a novel architecture that aims at realizing the first step towards intent modeling and mapping to data-plane configurations for NDNs. In I2DN, network operators and application developers express their abstract and declarative content delivery and network service goals and constraints using uttered or written intents. The intents are classified using built-in intent templates, and a slot filling procedure identifies the semantics of the intent. We then employ Event-B machine (EBM) language modeling to represent these intents and their semantics. The resulting EBMs are then gradually refined to represent configurations at the NDN programmable data-plane. The advantages of the proposed adoption of EBM modeling are twofold. First, EBMs accurately capture the desired behavior of the network in response to the specified intents and automatically refine it into concrete configurations. Second, EBM’s formal verification property, referred to as its proof obligation, ensures that the desired properties of the network or its services, as defined by the intent, remain satisfied by the refined EBM representing the final data-plane configurations. Experimental evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our proposed work.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3158753","Discovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732947","Event-B machines;intent-driven networking;named data networks;programmable data-planes","Switches;Metadata;Solid modeling;IP networks;Transforms;Semantics","formal verification;Internet;Internet of Things;virtual reality","programmable NDN data-planes;Event-B machines;location-agnostic content delivery;in-network caching;data networks paradigm;hosting content-centric next-generation applications;virtual reality;intent-driven management;offered NDN services;I2DN;intent-driven NDN;intent modeling;network operators;application developers;abstract delivery;declarative content delivery;uttered written intents;intent templates;Event-B machine language;NDN programmable data-plane;EBM modeling;specified intents;EBM's formal verification property;final data-plane configurations;mapping applications intents","","","","54","CCBY","10 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While most existing LV segmentation methods focus on cardiac images of single modality or multi-modality, few have been devoted to images of mixed-modality. By Mixed-Modality, we mean that different modalities exist in the database, while for every subject, there is only one modality. In this paper, we propose a newly invented LV segmentation method from mixed-modality images: modality adaptation shape regression (MA-Shape). Compared to single-modality or multi-modality methods, the proposed MA-Shape can 1) be applied to images of new modality during the test phase, which improves the generalization of the learned methods, and 2) take advantage of existing samples of different modalities, which alleviates the high demand for multi-modality data. To achieve this, we propose a modality adaptation module to enhance the shape consistency between the MR and CT, and therefore improve the generalization of the model learned in one modality to new modalities. The experiments on a dataset with MR sequences of 145 subjects and CT scans of 96 subjects validate that the proposed MA-shape can achieve excellent performance by learning common shape information from images of mixed modality and improve the cross-modality generalization of shape regression model learned on images of one modality. These advantages not only provide an efficient way of utilizing mix-modalities data during model learning but also enables an effective and flexible way of applying automated cardiac function assessment in clinical practice.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2892965","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572300,81871508,61773246); Taishan Scholar Program of Shandong Province of China(grant numbers:TSHW201502038); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ZR2018ZB0419); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8611328","Left ventricle segmentation;mixed-modality images;modality adaptation shape regression","Shape;Image segmentation;Computed tomography;Myocardium;Adaptation models;Training;Biomedical imaging","biomedical MRI;cardiology;computerised tomography;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;regression analysis","mixed-modality images;modality adaptation shape regression;single-modality;multimodality methods;modality adaptation module;MA-shape;cross-modality generalization;shape regression model;mix-modalities data;left ventricle segmentation;cardiac images;mixed MR images;CT images;LV segmentation methods","","4","","36","OAPA","13 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

During the CC charge state, the proposed converter is operating with the LCL-T resonant tank, and it can be regarded as a current source, which provides constant charging current to the battery. During the CV charge state, the LCL-T resonant tank is bypassed and the structure of the proposed converter is modified to a traditional LLC resonant converter, and it is functioning as a CV source. Owing to the high accuracy of the CC and voltage sources, the required operating switching frequency range can be significantly reduced when compared with traditional LLC approaches.

For example, many LLC design methods require massive simulations to finalize the circuit parameters, iterations are necessary, which can be tedious and time-consuming. Therefore, in this work, accurate and complete steady state simulation tools based on MATLAB graphical user interface (GUI) are designed for LLC resonant converters. All common and possible operation modes and LLC converter topologies are included in the designed simulation tools, which makes them practical for different applications and operation conditions. An improved mode judgement method and guidelines for initial point setting are proposed to ensure fast simulation speed.

However, most of these methods use word2vec technology to represent sequential text information, while ignoring the logic and internal hierarchy of the text itself. Although these approaches can learn the hypothetical hierarchy and logic of the text, it is unexplained. In addition, the traditional approach treats labels as independent individuals and ignores the relationships between them, which not only does not reflect reality but also causes significant loss of semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Transformer based deep learning model for large-scale multi-label text classification. We first model the text into a graph structure that can embody the different semantics of the text and the connections between them. We then use a multi-layer transformer structure with a multi-head attention mechanism at the word, sentence, and graph levels to fully capture the features of the text and observe the importance of the separate parts. Finally, we use the hierarchical relationship of the labels to generate the representation of the labels, and design a weighted loss function based on the semantic distances of the labels. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrated that the proposed model can realistically capture the hierarchy and logic of text and improve performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2972751","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8988213","Multi-label text classification;graph modeling;graph transformer;deep learning","Deep learning;Semantics;Task analysis;Natural language processing;Computer crashes;Text categorization;Feature extraction","graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;text analysis","sequential text information;deep learning model;large-scale multilabel text classification;multilayer transformer structure;multihead attention mechanism;word2vec technology;hierarchical graph transformer-based deep learning","","26","1","58","CCBY","10 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes a semi-automated 3D multi-scale residual convolutional network (3D ResNet) for lacunar infarcts detection, which can learn global representations of the anatomical location of lacunes using two multi-scale magnetic resonance image modalities. This process requires minimal user intervention by passing the potential suspicious lacunes into the network. The proposed network is trained, validated, and tested using five-fold cross-validation using data, including 696 lacunes, from 288 subjects. We also present experiments on various combinations of multi-scale inputs and their effect on extracting global context features that directly influence identification performance. The proposed system shows its capability to differentiate between true lacunes and lacune mimics, providing supportive interpretations for neuroradiologists. The proposed 3D multi-scale ResNet identifies lacunar infarcts with a sensitivity of 96.41%, a specificity of 90.92%, an overall accuracy of 93.67%, and an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 93.67% over all fold tests.

It steadily worsens from mild to severe, impairing one's ability to complete any work without assistance. It begins to outstrip due to the population ages and diagnosis timeline. For classifying cases, existing approaches incorporate medical history, neuropsychological testing, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), but efficient procedures remain inconsistent due to lack of sensitivity and precision. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is utilized to create a framework that can be used to detect specific Alzheimer's disease characteristics from MRI images. By considering four stages of dementia and conducting a particular diagnosis, the proposed model generates high-resolution disease probability maps from the local brain structure to a multilayer perceptron and provides accurate, intuitive visualizations of individual Alzheimer's disease risk. To avoid the problem of class imbalance, the samples should be evenly distributed among the classes. The obtained MRI image dataset from Kaggle has a major class imbalance problem. A DEMentia NETwork (DEMNET) is proposed to detect the dementia stages from MRI. The DEMNET achieves an accuracy of 95.23%, Area Under Curve (AUC) of 97% and Cohen's Kappa value of 0.93 from the Kaggle dataset, which is superior to existing methods.

In recent years, many novel machine learning models have been developed for credit scoring. Among the existing machine learning models, the heterogeneous ensemble model receives much attention because of its superior performance. This paper presents a new heterogeneous ensemble model based on the generalized Shapley value and the Choquet integral. To do this, the model first uses the fuzzy measure to express the interactive characteristics between any two coalitions of base learners. Based on the accuracy and diversity objective function, a linear programming model for determining the fuzzy measure is built. To retain the original information as much as possible in the training stage, the normal fuzzy number is employed to express the base learner predicted values. Then, the generalized Shapley Choquet integral (GSCI) aggregation operator is defined to calculate the comprehensive predicted value of the ensemble model. Based on the defined aggregation operator and linear programming model, a GSCI approach is proposed for ensemble credit scoring. To illustrate the efficiency and feasibility of the GSCI approach, an experiment of thirteen machine learning models over four public credit scoring datasets and three real-world P2P leading datasets with large volumes of samples is made. Furthermore, robust tests and comparatives analysis are made to demonstrate the adaptability and performance of the GSCI-based ensemble model.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3043937","Key Project of National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71991463,91846301); Major Consulting Projects of Chinese Academy of Engineering(grant numbers:2019-ZD-32-06); Project of National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61702183); Key Research and Development Project for Science and Technology Department of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2019GK2131); Key Laboratory of Hunan Province for New Retail Virtual Reality Technology, Hunan University of Commerce(grant numbers:2017TP1026); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9290016","Credit scoring;heterogeneous ensemble;normal fuzzy number;the Choquet integral;the generalized Shapley function","Predictive models;Analytical models;Training;Linear programming;Diversity reception;Bagging;Stacking","financial data processing;financial management;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;peer-to-peer computing;risk management","real-world P2P leading datasets;training stage;interactive characteristics;financial institutions;credit risk management;novel GSCI-based ensemble approach;public credit scoring datasets;ensemble credit scoring;GSCI approach;comprehensive predicted value;generalized Shapley Choquet integral aggregation operator;base learner predicted values;normal fuzzy number;linear programming model;diversity objective function;fuzzy measure;generalized Shapley value;heterogeneous ensemble model;novel machine learning models","","8","","71","CCBY","10 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The trade-off between voltage class and module compaction must be quantified. This work presents a methodology to model the tradeoff for any substrate and encapsulant material. A surface charge density-based partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) model was developed to overcome the challenges in electric field-based models. The model consists of a closed-form equation that accepts finite element simulation results as input and produces PDIV as output. The model was experimentally validated for various trace gaps in a 12/25/12 mil alumina DBC using Dow Corning 3-6635 dielectric gel. An expected trend of diminishing returns was observed between PDIV benefit and trace-gap. This approach quantifies this diminishing returns point. To design for reliability, the maximum operating voltage must be limited to the PDIV. For a material set and manufacturing process, this methodology can be used to determine the voltage class and trace gap design rules.","2644-1314","","10.1109/OJPEL.2023.3241853","Army Research Laboratory(grant numbers:W911NF1820087); National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center(grant numbers:EEC-1449548); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10035407","Partial discharge;design rules;power modules;design-for-reliability;dielectrics;electrical breakdown","Partial discharges;Multichip modules;Mathematical models;Electric breakdown;Reliability;Density measurement;Ceramics","","","","","","38","CCBY","2 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the other hand, ResNet+FPN instead of VGG16 and ResNet backbone structure is adopted as the low-level feature extractor, so extracting capability for small features can be enhanced effectively. Furthermore, to precisely locate the position of clustered peppers, a height calculation model combining the 2D image recognition results with its depth information is advanced. Comparative experiments show that the overall accuracy AP and AP50 of our method reach 75.79% and 87.30%, respectively.

In view of the importance of this identificationtask, METRIC (METamorphic Relation Identification based on Category-choice framework) was developed to help software testersidentify MRs from a given set of complete test frames. However, during MR identification, METRIC primarily focuses on the inputdomain without sufficient attention given to the output domain, thereby hindering the effectiveness of METRIC.

The student's demographic features prediction has a significant aspect for the learning activities in educational institutions. The current studies predicted the student's native place based on technological awareness having various features such as development, availability, usability, educational benefits, etc. However,these studies have not explored the identification of sentiment identification about the technology through ML,optimization,etc.Motivated from these facts,in this paper, we propose a machine learning (ML) model with optimizing techniques to tune the hyper-parameters. In the proposed model, a primary dataset gathered from Indian and Hungarian universities, which analyzed with a Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP) with three popular optimization algorithms, such as Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (LBFGS). The optimized MLP has compared with the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Besides, numerous testing methods and to select the most prominent features, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) trained both models. Association of the Adam optimizer with the ReLu activation function in the MLP proved significant play in prediction with regularization. The PCA components covering most of the variance improved the optimized MLP accuracy with 2.3% and boosted the accuracy of the SVM with 2.9%. The Gain-ratio and the Info-gain suggested 11 features with significant weights. Both predictive models are found not only competitive but also outperformed with an identical prediction accuracy of 94% to identify the native place of the student. The Statistical t-test supported the equal predictive strength of both models and proved the significant enhancement in the SVM performance using the PCA components. Further, a considerable reduction is also achieved in the prediction error and prediction time to support the institute's web-based real-time system. Based on deep experiments, we recommend the optimistic native identification models for the higher educational institutions to analyze the attitude and technical awareness among students based on their native place.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3008830","Hungarian Government and Co-financed; European Social Fund under the project “Talent Management in Autonomous Vehicle Control Technologies (EFOP-3.6.3-VEKOP-16-2017-00001)”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9139239","Adam;native place;PCA;optimizer;real-time prediction SGD","Support vector machines;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Real-time systems;Machine learning algorithms;Machine learning;Principal component analysis","computer aided instruction;educational institutions;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;optimisation;principal component analysis;support vector machines","stochastic gradient descent;limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno;statistical t-test;optimistic native identification;ReLu activation function;Adam optimizer;principal component analysis;SVM;support vector machine;adaptive moment estimation;multilayer-perceptron;sentiment identification;educational benefits;learning activities;mindset reading;machine learning;higher educational institutions;PCA components;equal predictive strength","","54","","52","CCBY","13 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Uncertainty measure is an effective tool for evaluation. This paper explores information structures and uncertainty measures in an IPSIS. According to the Bhattacharyya distance, the distance between two objects in a given subsystem of an IPSIS is first proposed. Then, the tolerance relation on an object set, induced by a probability set-valued information system by using this distance, is obtained. Next, the information structure of this subsystem is introduced by a set vector. Moreover, the dependence between two information structures is studied by using the inclusion degree. Finally, as an application for information structures, measures of uncertainty for an IPSIS are investigated, and to evaluate the performance of the proposed measures, effectiveness analysis is given from the angle of statistics.

And, the model could identify the driver's braking intent prior to his braking operation. Research limitations/implications - The limitation of this study was that the experimental environment was ideal and did not consider the surrounding traffic. At the same time, other actions of the driver were not taken into account when establishing the braking intention recognition model. Besides, the verification results obtained in this paper could only reflect the results of a few drivers' identification of braking intention.

First-order association potentials are modeled as the composite of an appearance potential, a Hessian-based shape potential and a non-linear location potential. Second-order interaction potentials are modeled using an auto-logistic (smoothing) potential and a data-dependent (edge) potential. Minimal post-processing is used for excluding voxels outside the brain parenchyma and visualizing the surface vessels. The CRF model is trained and validated using 30 SWI venograms acquired within a population of deep brain stimulation (DBS) patients (age range = 43-73 years). Results demonstrate robust and consistent segmentation in deep and sub-cortical regions (median kappa = 0.84 and 0.82), as well as in challenging mid-sagittal and surface regions (median kappa = 0.81 and 0.83) regions.

For recovery, we propose combining the scale-invariant feature transform point matching and the shift and rotation estimation method using a Euclidean transformation matrix. For watermark embedding and detection, a discrete Fourier transform magnitude coefficient is used. With the shift-invariant characteristic, our proposed method is robust against viewpoint desynchronization. Because finding an accurate viewpoint is difficult, our method offers a substantial advantage in the spherical panorama image watermarking scheme. Furthermore, it allows watermark detection on a continuous viewpoint spherical panorama system.

This work uses deep learning methods for sensor fusion of 116 plastic optical fiber (POF) distributed sensors for gait recognition. The floor sensor system captures spatiotemporal samples due to varying ground reaction force (GRF) in multiples of up to 4 uninterrupted steps on a continuous 2×1 m area. We demonstrate classifications of gait signatures, achieving up to 100% F1-score with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), in the context of gait recognition of 21 subjects, with imposters and clients.

Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) methods are employed to decompose a trained neural network prediction to relevant standard events in the gait cycle, by generating a “heat map” over the input used for classification. This allows valuable insight into which parts of the gait spatiotemporal signal have the heaviest influence on the gait classification and consequently, which gait events, such as heel strike or toe-off, are mostly affected by cognitive load.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2021.3078336","Government of Saudi Arabia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9425580","Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN);cognitive load;ground reaction force (GRF);sensors fusion;interpretable neural networks","Sensors;Legged locomotion;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Sensor systems;Floors;Task analysis;Optical fibers","distributed sensors;gait analysis;image fusion;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets;patient diagnosis;patient rehabilitation;sport;virtual reality","spatiotemporal analysis;gait signatures;floor sensors;gait pattern variation;industrial applications;commercial applications;mental illness diagnosis;gait variability;gait intervals;cognitive demanding tasks;deep learning methods;sensor fusion;116 plastic optical fiber distributed sensors;gait recognition;floor sensor system captures spatiotemporal samples;cognitive load;manifested lower F1-scores;Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation methods;gait cycle;gait spatiotemporal signal;gait classification","","1","","49","CCBY","7 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has been pointed out that WMH is closely associated with stroke, cognitive impairment, dementia, and even is very relevant to the increased risk of death. This paper proposes a new iterative linearly constrained minimum variance (ILCMV) classification-based method which expands an iterative constrained energy minimization (ICEM) detection-based method developed for hyperspectral image classification. It explores the potential of ILCMV combined with different spatial filters in classification of brain normal tissues and WMH and also develops an alternative version of ILCMV, called Multi-class ICEM (MCICEM) for a comparative study. The synthetic images in BrainWeb are used for quantitative evaluation of ILCMV and the real brain MR images are used for visual assessment. The experimental results suggest that the Gaussian filter is most suitable for ILCMV and MCICEM if the computational time is factored into consideration. Otherwise, ILCMV/MCICEM combined with a Gabor filter yields the best classification. In addition, the average Dice similarity indexes (DSI) of CSF/GM/WM volume measurement produced by ILCMV method combined with Gaussian filter were 0.936/0.948/0.975 in synthetic MR images with all noise levels and were better than the results reported in the literature. ILCMV can simultaneously classifies brain normal tissues and WMH lesions in MR brain images and does better than detection of WMH alone. In addition, its computational time is also less than MCICEM. It is our belief that the proposed methodology demonstrates its promising in classification of brain tissue and WMH in MRI applications.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931761","Taichung Veterans General Hospital(grant numbers:TCVGH-1067315C); Ministry of Science and Technology(grant numbers:MOST-106-2221-E-075A-004,MOST-108-2221-E-075A-002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8779620","Iterative linear constrained minimum variance (ILCMV);White matter hyperintensities (WMH);magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);brain tissue classification","Magnetic resonance imaging;Gabor filters;Lesions;White matter;Hyperspectral imaging;Information filters","biological tissues;biomedical MRI;brain;diseases;Gabor filters;image classification;image segmentation;iterative methods;medical image processing;neurophysiology","iterative mixed pixel classification;brain tissue;white matter hyperintensity;magnetic resonance imaging;minimum variance classification-based method;iterative constrained energy minimization detection-based method;hyperspectral image classification;different spatial filters;brain normal tissues;synthetic images;brain MR images;Gaussian filter;ILCMV method;synthetic MR images;WMH lesions;MR brain images;Multiclass ICEM","","6","","27","CCBY","29 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The reconstruction of the 3-D catheter trajectory was obtained by the vertical intersection of spatial surfaces which were derived from the 2-D catheter curves in the angiography plane. Computational fluid dynamics was applied to calculate the hemodynamics in the coronary arteries and coronary flow-based FFR (fFFR) was obtained.

The approach is based on the concept of self-rank, defined as the minimum number of samples needed to express all dataset samples with an accuracy proportional to the rank- $K$  approximation. As the exact computation of self-rank requires a computationally expensive combinatorial search, we propose an efficient algorithm that jointly estimates self-rank and selects the most informative samples in a linear order of complexity w.r.t the data size. We derive a new upper bound for the approximation ratio (AR), the ratio of obtained projection error using selected samples to the best rank- $K$  approximation error. The best previously known AR for self-representative low-rank approximation was presented in ICML 2017, which was further improved by the bound  $\sqrt {1+K}$  reported in NeurIPS 2019. Both of these bounds are obtained by brute force search, which is not practical, and these bounds depend solely on  $K$ , the number of selected samples. In contrast, we describe an adaptive AR that takes into consideration the spectral properties and spikiness measure of the original dataset,  ${\boldsymbol {A}\in \mathbb {R}^{N\times M}}$ . In particular, our performance bound is proportional to the condition number  $\kappa (\boldsymbol {A})$ . Our derived AR is expressed as  $1+(\kappa (\boldsymbol {A})^{2}-1)/(N-K)$ , which approaches 1 and is optimal in two extreme spectral distribution instances. In the worst case, AR is shown not to exceed 1.25 for the proposed method. Our proposed algorithm enjoys linear complexity w.r.t. size of original dataset, which results in filling a historical gap between practical and theoretical methods in finding representatives. In addition to evaluating the proposed algorithm on a synthetic dataset, we show that it can be utilized in real-world applications such as graph node sampling for optimizing the shortest path criterion, learning a classifier with representative data, and open-set identification.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3198597","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1956339); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9855488","Column subset selection;data summarization;graph node selection;low-rank;meta learning;open-set identification;self-rank;spectrum pursuit;SVD","Approximation algorithms;Data models;Upper bound;Matrix decomposition;Image reconstruction;Principal component analysis;Optimization;Learning systems","approximation theory;computational complexity;deep learning (artificial intelligence);graph theory;search problems;set theory","spectrum pursuit;residual descent;column subset selection problem;deep learning;dataset summarization;unsupervised dataset;self-rank;dataset samples;computationally expensive combinatorial search;informative samples;approximation ratio;projection error;rank-K approximation error;self-representative low-rank approximation;brute force search;spectral properties;condition number;extreme spectral distribution instances;linear complexity;graph node sampling;representative data;AR","","1","","57","CCBY","11 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on global context, the three-column Feature Processor constitutes an adaptive feature generator. Third, a novel loss function which integrates Euclidean distance and spatial correlation is proposed to enhance the spatial correlation and consistency between pixels.

The first decoding scheme treats interference from parallel transmissions as noise while the second one utilizes the parallel transmission to apply successive decoding for the intended data. Furthermore, network and cache related factors are identified and their impact on the overall performance of the system are analyzed.

In order to address these problems, this work proposes a low-dimensional feature using histogram entropy and a prototype selection algorithm using hyperrectangles. The low-dimensional feature forms an  $L \times 256$  map according to the preselected parameter  $L$ . The prototype selection algorithm divides the input space into overlapping subspaces where each subspace is decided by its hyperrectangle that becomes a prototype in the same class. A set cover optimization algorithm is employed to select a small number of prototypes that construct a new training dataset. A set of prototypes selected by the prototype selection algorithm is used to classify malware families. The experiment compares the performance of machine learning models for the histogram entropy feature using both the BIG 2015 dataset and the collected dataset. The integrated approach is evaluated using learning algorithms, such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and CNN.

In contrast, this paper investigates the uplink ergodic spectral efficiency (SE) of each user under the double scattering channel model. We derive a closed-form expression of the uplink ergodic SE by exploiting the maximum ratio (MR) combining technique based on imperfect channel state information. We further study the asymptotic SE behaviors as a function of the number of antennas at each base station (BS) and the number of scatterers available at each radio channel. We then formulate and solve a total energy optimization problem for the uplink data transmission that aims at simultaneously satisfying the required SEs from all the users with limited data power resource. Notably, our proposed algorithms can cope with the congestion issue appearing when at least one user is served by lower SE than requested. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the closed-form ergodic SE over Monte-Carlo simulations. Besides, the system can still provide the required SEs to many users even under congestion.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2021.3108849","Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for Smart Cities (RISOTTI)(grant numbers:FNR/C20/IS/14773976/RISOTTI); U.K. Research and Innovation Future Leaders Fellowships(grant numbers:MR/S017666/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9531522","Massive MIMO;double scattering channels;total transmit power minimization;congestion issue","Massive MIMO;Uplink;Scattering;Optimization;Antennas;Rayleigh channels;Channel models","5G mobile communication;diversity reception;electromagnetic wave scattering;Gaussian channels;MIMO communication;Monte Carlo methods;optimisation;power control;telecommunication control;telecommunication power management","base station;radio channel;total energy optimization problem;uplink data transmission;data power resource;closed-form ergodic SE;uplink power control;massive MIMO;double scattering channels;energy efficiency;wireless networks;complex Gaussian channel impulse responses;rich-scattering environments;uplink ergodic spectral efficiency;double scattering channel model;uplink ergodic SE;maximum ratio combining technique;imperfect channel state information;asymptotic SE behaviors;Monte-Carlo simulations","","6","","42","CCBY","8 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the advancement of remote sensing technologies, multiple geological remote sensing-derived prospecting methods have been developed. With the development of more accurate sensors, the detection band has not been segmented, and the spectral resolution of such sensors is constantly being improved. Thus, the accuracy of remote sensing geological prospecting methods has improved, and geological prospecting results have shifted from being qualitative to quantitative in nature. In this article, high-resolution remote sensing images are used to extract the ore controlling factors of deposits. The color, shape, texture and other image shapes produced by high-resolution remote sensing images are fully exploited to comprehensively mine the available data utilizing mathematics, image processing methods and other technologies to systematically identify prospective target areas. Based on an analysis of the metalloorganic geological characteristics detected in the study area, combined with multisource data such as geophysical and geochemical exploration-derived observations, the proposed remote sensing model describing the deposits in the study area is summarized.

In recent years, human-computer interaction behavior has appeared more and more in daily life. Especially with the rapid development of computer vision technology, the human-centered human-computer interaction technology is bound to replace computer-centered human-computer interaction technology. The study of gesture recognition is in line with this trend, and gesture recognition provides a way for many devices to interact with humans. The traditional gesture recognition method requires manual extraction of feature values, which is a time-consuming and laborious method. In order to break through the bottleneck, we propose a new gesture recognition algorithm based on the convolutional neural network and deep convolution generative adversarial networks. We apply this method to expression recognition, calculation, and text output, and achieve good results. The experiments show that the proposed method can train the model to identify with fewer samples and achieve better gesture classification and detection effects. Moreover, this gesture recognition method is less susceptible to illumination and background interference. It also can achieve an efficient real-time recognition effect.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2901930","State Key Laboratory of Novel Software Technology(grant numbers:KFKT2018B23); Priority Academic Program Development of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Zhejiang University(grant numbers:A1916); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8653825","Calculation;CNN;DCGAN;gesture recognition;text output","Gesture recognition;Human computer interaction;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks;Training;Convolution","computer vision;convolutional neural nets;gesture recognition;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);man-machine systems","deep convolution generative adversarial networks;expression recognition;gesture classification;real-time recognition effect;visual recognition;speech recognition;human-computer interaction behavior;computer vision technology;computer-centered human-computer interaction technology;gesture recognition algorithm;gesture recognition method;CNN;DCGAN","","23","","18","OAPA","27 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, with the development of remote sensing technology, while the resolution of remote sensing images is improved, the information describing ground objects becomes more and more abundant, and the difficulty of identifying and extracting road information is also increased. In the process of acquiring remote sensing images, the actual system is subjected to various kinds of noise interference. Different environmental interference and system defects will introduce noises with completely different distribution and statistical characteristics to remote sensing images. Aiming at the problem that the detection effect of traditional algorithms becomes worse due to the influence of noise on remote sensing images, a wavelet transform denoising method and morphological gradient operator are proposed. By selecting appropriate structural elements of remote sensing images, noise pixels cannot participate in morphological calculation, and the noise intensity changes with the size of quantum superposition state structural elements. Therefore, a morphological gradient operator is established and applied to edge detection of remote sensing images. Finally, the experimental results show that the method proposed in this article is better than other directions in terms of effect through road edge detection and matching. This method can effectively reduce noise.

The hidden Markov model (HMM) is a classic machine learning model that has been widely applied in the fields of time-series data mining. In this study, we aim to predict the severity of locust plague in croplands using the time-series dynamic change features extracted from remote sensing data via HMM. In addition, we assess the damages on the croplands using change detection methods by comparing the crop spectrum before and after the locust plague from two-phase (Feburary 23 and March 7, 2020) hyperspectral images covering substudy area (northern Narok, Kenya). Evaluated by the ground truth data, the OA of predicted results of the plague severity in April, May, June, and July are 0.78, 0.71, 0.74, and 0.72, respectively. The land cover classification OA of the substudy area of the two-phase images are 97.45 and 96.14.

Because detectors in the same row share the same lower butterfly frequency but different higher butterfly frequency, a pumping signal at the sum frequency of the dipole mode and the higher butterfly mode can selectively activate individual resonators, leading to 4-fold sensitivity gain over passive coupling. Meanwhile, a pumping signal at the sum frequency of the dipole mode and the lower butterfly mode can simultaneously activate multiple resonators in the same row, leading to 3-fold sensitivity gain over passive coupling. When multiple rows of detectors are parallelly aligned, each row has a unique lower butterfly frequency for consecutive activation during the acquisition interval of the others.

At least 75% of patients with CIEDs will need magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during their lifetime. In 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first MR-conditional CIEDs for patients with endocardial systems, in which leads are passed through the vein and affixed to the endocardium. The majority of children, however, receive an epicardial CIED, where leads are directly sewn to the epicardium.

Two NDP messages are used during AR and DAD to communicate with one another in the same IPv6 link-local network, namely Neighbour Solicitation (NS) and Neighbour Advertisement (NA) messages. However, NDP messages have non-secure designs and lack verification mechanisms for authenticating whether incoming messages originate from a legitimate or illegitimate node. Therefore, any node in the same link can manipulate NS or NA messages and then launch a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. Techniques proposed to secure AR and DAD include Secure NDP (SeND) and Trust-NDP (Trust-ND); however, these techniques either entail high processing time and bandwidth consumption or are vulnerable to DoS attacks because of their designs. Therefore, to secure AR and DAD, this study aims to introduce a prevention technique called Match-Prevention, which secures target IP addresses and exchange messages (i.e. NS and NA). The processing time, bandwidth consumption and DoS prevention success rate of Match-Prevention in different scenarios are evaluated, and its performance is compared with those of existing techniques, including Standard-Process (i.e., Standard-AR and Standard-DAD), SeND and Trust-ND. Results show that Match-Prevention requires less processing time during AR and DAD processes and less bandwidth consumption compared with other existing techniques. In terms of DoS prevention success rate, the experiments show that Standard-Process and Trust-ND are unable to secure AR and DAD from DoS attacks, whilst SeND is vulnerable to flooding attacks. By contrast, Match-Prevention allows IPv6 nodes to verify the incoming message, discard the fake message before further processing and prevent a DoS attack during AR and DAD in an IPv6 link-local network.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970787","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia(grant numbers:FRGS 203.PNAV.6711836); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8977518","IPv6 link-local Network;neighbour discovery protocol;duplicate address detection;address resolution","IP networks;Protocols;Internet;Local area networks;Monitoring;Denial-of-service attack","computer network security;IP networks;transport protocols","bandwidth consumption;DoS attack;target IP addresses;DoS prevention success rate;Standard-Process;Standard-DAD;DAD processes;Trust-ND;IPv6 nodes;fake message;IPv6 link-local network;denial-of-service attack;address resolution;neighbour discovery protocol;Internet Protocol version 6 host;neighbouring hosts;NDP messages;nonsecure designs;NA messages;NS messages;neighbour solicitation;neighbour advertisement messages;duplicate address detection processes;match-prevention technique","","14","","39","CCBY","31 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Intrusion detection is an active network security defense measure, which is an attempt to invade, an ongoing intrusion or an intrusion that has occurred to identify the process. At present, the detection rate of intrusion detection method is low, the false alarm rate and false alarm rate is high, and the real-time performance is poor. It needs a large number of or complete data to achieve better detection performance. In this paper, the concept, characteristics, classification, research contents and difficulties of traditional intrusion detection for mass multimedia data transmission network are described. Then, the basic principle of neural network and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the basic idea of particle swarm optimization algorithm with quantum (QPSO) behaviour are introduced. It is emphasized that QPSO has better convergence performance than PSO algorithm in global optimization problems. In this paper, the concept, characteristics and structure of neural network are described, and the algorithm and classification of wavelet neural network are introduced. Then taking wavelet neural network (WNN) as the object, using the QPSO algorithm as the training algorithm, the concrete operation process is given. The research work in this paper shows that the performance of neural network trained by QPSO algorithm and improved QPSO algorithm is better than that of other intelligent algorithms such as PSO algorithm and genetic algorithm, and the convergence speed is faster than that of PSO algorithm or GA algorithm.

In clinical treatment, the imaging process suffers from high-risk, expensive, and time-consuming due to using contrast agents (CA). Furthermore, manual segmentation has the disadvantages of tedious, low-reproducibility, and high misdiagnosis rate. Although some deep-learning based works have attempted for liver lesions segmentation, they are all limited to the use of contrast-enhanced MRI. To avoid the limitations comes from CA, we proposed a Radiomics-guided Densely-UNet-Nested Generative Adversarial Networks (Radiomics-guided DUN-GAN) for automatic segmentation of liver lesions on non-contrast MRI. Radiomics-guided DUN-GAN includes a DUN segmentor and a Radiomics-guided discriminator. It uses radiomics feature of the multi-phase contrast image as prior knowledge to guide the extraction of key implicit contrast radiomics (ICR) features in non-contrast images, thus achieving the direct lesions segmentation without CA for the first time. In the DUN segmentor, an innovative nested structure of Densely-UNet-connection reliably completes the segmentation. The nested structure extracts global features, semantic features, and ICR features by reasonably sharing features and maximizing information flow. Those features are fused with a new direction strategy of multi-integration features to improve the segmentation ability. In the innovative Radiomics-guided discriminator, the radiomics feature combined with the semantic feature enhances the discrimination of Radiomics-guided discriminator. Moreover, it guides the segmentor for multiple feature extraction via using the adversarial mechanism. Radiomics-guided DUN-GAN learns the mapping relationship between images, extracting the key ICR in the non-contrast image, and finally completing the accurate segmentation. Radiomics-guided DUN-GAN obtained the Dice Similarity Coefficient results of 93.47± 0.83% for the segmentation of lesions in non-contrast images from 250 clinical subjects. The results verify the Radiomics-guided DUN-GAN is accurate and robust, and it has the possibility of becoming a safe, inexpensive, and time-saving medical assistant tool in clinical diagnosis.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3047429","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872261,61972274); Open Funding Project of State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems, Beihang University(grant numbers:2018-VRLAB2018B07); Research Project Supported by Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province(grant numbers:201801D121139); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9309035","Liver lesions;segmentation;radiomics-feature;multi-phase non-contrast MRI;GAN","Image segmentation;Lesions;Feature extraction;Liver;Radiomics;Magnetic resonance imaging;Shape","biomedical MRI;convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;image segmentation;liver;medical image processing","noncontrast image;contrast agents;noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging;contrast-enhanced MRI;automatic liver lesion segmentation;multiphase contrast image;radiomics-guided densely-UNet-nested generative adversarial networks;noncontrast MRI image;implicit contrast radiomics;feature extraction;clinical diagnosis","","2","","55","CCBY","25 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Realistically however, we aim not only to correctly predict failures, but also to protect data against failure, i.e., we need to take appropriate action after a failure prediction. In the context of storage systems, protecting data requires that we migrate at-risk data, but this consumes network and disk bandwidth, which is particularly problematic for large-scale and cloud systems. This paper consolidates and builds on Li et al. (2016), where we propose using two new metrics, migration rate (MR) and mismigration rate (MMR), to measure the quality of disk failure prediction: MR measures how much at-risk data is migrated (and therefore protected) as a result of correct failure predictions, while MMR measures how much data is migrated needlessly as a result of incorrect failure predictions. In this paper, we additionally propose measuring quality in terms of migration time and mismigration time, which measure the time spent migrating at-risk disks, and the time spent mismigrating healthy disks caused by false alarms, respectively. To demonstrate these metrics' usefulness, we use them to compare disk-failure prediction methods: we compare: 1) a classification tree (CT) model against a state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN) model and 2) a gradient-boosted regression tree (GBRT) model (which predicts residual life) against RNN. We observe that while RNN performs best in the prediction accuracy experiments, the CT and GBRT models sometimes outperform RNN in the resource-dependent migrationrate experiments. We conclude that prediction accuracy is sometimes misleading: correct predictions do not necessarily imply protected data. We additionally present an improved GBRT model (GBRT+), which offers a practical improvement in disk residual-life prediction accordingly to the newly proposed metrics.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2884004","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61702521,61602266,61872201,U1833114); NSF of Tianjin(grant numbers:4117JCYBJC15300); Science and Technology Development Plan of Tianjin(grant numbers:17JCYBJC15300,16JCYBJC41900); Civil Aviation University of China(grant numbers:2017QD03S); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; SAFEA: Overseas Young Talents in Cultural and Educational Sector; Thousand Youth Talents Plan in Tianjin; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8552338","Disk failure prediction;evaluation metrics;migration accuracy;resource consumption;cloud storage system","Predictive models;Time measurement;Data models;Hidden Markov models;Recurrent neural networks;Cloud computing","disc storage;failure analysis;gradient methods;pattern classification;recurrent neural nets;regression analysis;trees (mathematics)","disk-failure prediction models;disk bandwidth;disk failure prediction;correct failure predictions;migration time;at-risk disks;healthy disks;disk-failure prediction methods;gradient-boosted regression tree model;disk residual-life prediction;recurrent neural network model;classification tree model","","5","","33","OAPA","29 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Transform is a key technique for compression efficiency, and core experiment 6 (CE6) in JVET is established to explore the transform-related coding tools. In this paper, we propose a novel signal-independent separable transform based on the Karhunen-Loève transform (KLT) to improve the efficiency of both intra and inter residual coding. In the proposed method, the drawbacks of the traditional KLT are addressed. A group of mode-independent intra transform matrices is calculated from abundant intra residual samples of all intra modes, while the inter separable KLT matrices are trained with the residuals that cannot be efficiently processed by the discrete cosine transform type II (DCT-II). The separable KLT is developed as an additional transform type apart from DCT-II. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve 2.7% and 1.5% bitrate saving averagely under All Intra and Random Access configurations on top of the reference software of VVC (VTM-1.1).

Evaluation and identification of effective fungicides are essential for control of FHB. However, traditional methods based on the manual disease severity assessment to evaluate the efficacy of fungicides are time-consuming and laborsome. In this study, we developed a new method to rapidly assess the severity of FHB and evaluate the efficacy of fungicide application programs. Enhanced red-green-green (RGG) images were processed from acquired raw red-green-blue (RGB) images of wheat ear samples; the images were transformed in color spaces through K-means clustering for rough segmentation of wheat ears; a random forest classifier was used with features of color, texture, geometry and vegetation index for fine segmentation of disease spots in wheat ears; a newly proposed width mutation counting algorithm was used to count wheat ears; and the disease severity of the wheat ears groups was graded and the efficacy of six fungicides was evaluated. The results show that the segmentation algorithm could segment wheat ears from a complex field background. And the counting algorithm could effectively solve the problem of wheat ear adhesion and occlusion.

This paper proposes a real-time direct principal component analysis (PCA)-based technique which offers a robust approach for motion estimation of abdominal organs and allows correcting motion related artifacts. The PCA was used to detect spatio-temporal coherences of the periodic organ motion in a learning step. During the interventional procedure, physiological contributions were characterized quantitatively using a small set of parameters. A coarse-to-fine resolution scheme is proposed to improve the stability of the algorithm and afford a predictable constant latency of 80 ms. The technique was evaluated on 12 free-breathing volunteers and provided an improved real-time description of motion related to both breathing and cardiac cycles.

This study emphasizes that in addition to the importance of the MCNN structure, the parameter design within the layers is also very important. After determining the structure of the MCNN, the parameter optimization in the layer can improve the performance of the MCNN. The MCNN parameters for convolutional layers include filter size, number of filters, padding, and filter stride. Parameters for max-pooling layers also include pooling size and pooling stride. After the MCNN architecture is designed, the major challenge is finding the combination of parameters that enhances the MCNN performance. The proposed MAOM optimizes the MCNN parameters by integrating uniform experimental design (UED), multiple regression (MR), and optimization method. After the MCNN architecture is designed, UED is used to design the MCNN parameters. The parameter layout obtained by the UED is then used in experiments to collect data that can be used for modeling. Next, MR is performed using the parameters with the average correct rate to build an MCNN parameter model. Finally, a full-factorial search algorithm is used to find the best combination of the MCNN parameters for obtaining the maximum average correct rate. Images from the modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (modified NIST or MNIST) resources, Fashion-MNIST, and PhysioNet databases are used to test the performance of the architecture and parameters of the MCNN.

The Jellyfish attack is regarded as one of the most difficult attack to detect and degrades the overall network performance. In order to combat Jellyfish attack in MANETs, this paper proposes a novel technique called accurate prevention and detection of jelly fish attack detection (APD-JFAD). It is a fusion of authenticated routing-based framework for detecting attacks and support vector machine (SVM). SVM is utilized for learning packet forwarding behavior. The proposed technique chooses trusted nodes in the network for performing routing of packets on the basis of hierarchical trust evaluation property of nodes. The technique is tested using NS-2 simulator against other existing techniques, i.e., ABC, MABC, and AR-AIDF-GFRS algorithms by various parameters such as throughput, PDR, dropped packet ratio, and delay.

Auditory information plays an important role in information location, this comes from the fact that it can be difficult to find useful information. Thus audio classification becomes more important in audio analysis as it prepares for content-based audio retrieval. There is quite a bit of research on the topic of audio classification methods, audio feature analysis, and extraction based on audio classification. Many works of literature extract features of audio signals based on time or Fourier transform frequency domain. The emergence of the wavelet theory provides a time-frequency analysis tool for signal analysis. Wavelet transformation is a local transformation of the signal in time and frequency which can effectively extract information from the signal, and perform multi-scale refinement analysis on functions or signals through operations such as stretching and translation instead of the traditional Fourier transformation. In the time-frequency analysis of the signal, the wavelet analysis captures the local time and frequency characters of the signal which can improve the ability of signal analysis. It can also change certain locals of the signal without affecting other aspects of it. In this paper, the frequency domain features are combined with the wavelet domain features. At the same time that the MFCC features are extracted, the discrete wavelet transform is used to extract the features of the wavelet domain. Then the statistical features are extracted for each audio example, and the SVM model is used to realize the different forms of audio classification identification.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2988686","Science and Technology Granted by the Beijing Education Committee(grant numbers:KM201810038002); Key Members of the Outstanding Young Teacher by the Capital University of Economics and Business 2017; Top Talent of Youth Teacher by the Beijing Education Committee 2018; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9072167","Content audio;wavelet transform;audio feature;audio processing","Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Training;Time-frequency analysis;Artificial neural networks;Speech recognition;Fans","audio signal processing;discrete wavelet transforms;feature extraction;Fourier transforms;learning (artificial intelligence);signal classification;support vector machines;time-frequency analysis","audio example recognition;geometric incremental learning support vector machine system;multimedia data;important form;information media;auditory information;information location;audio analysis;content-based audio retrieval;audio classification methods;audio feature analysis;audio signals;wavelet theory;time-frequency analysis tool;signal analysis;wavelet transformation;local transformation;multiscale refinement analysis;traditional Fourier transformation;wavelet analysis;local time;frequency characters;frequency domain features;wavelet domain features;MFCC features;statistical features;audio classification identification","","5","","32","CCBY","20 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Large intelligent surfaces (LIS) as an evolution of massive MIMO have drawn considerable attention among researchers, being already considered as one of the key technologies to be included in beyond 5G communication systems. Due to the massive number of antennas, it also brings several challenges namely in terms of computational complexity. In this paper, we intend to provide guidelines for the LIS practical implementation and configuration by specifying system parameters and their consequent relationship for a panel-based LIS. In particular, the interplay between the number of baseband outputs per square metre, the fraction of activated area, the panel size and terminal density is summarised by an empirical law under the assumption that all terminals experience reasonable quality of service. Furthermore, performance results show that, in general, moderate panel sizes offer the best rates, highlighting that there is no need to activate a large fraction of LIS to provide an acceptable minimum terminal rate. However, such fractions may require more baseband outputs per panel, leading to a higher number of baseband outputs per square metre, translating into higher implementation complexity. Finally, it is observed that the implicit rate loss of using sparse static panel deployments instead of contiguous panel deployments that are dynamically activated/deactivated is not so significant, omitting the complexity involved in managing the set of activated panels.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3181757","Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia/Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior (FCT/MCTES) and the Instituto de Telecomunicações (IT) through National Funds(grant numbers:FEDER-PT2020); Competitiveness and Internationalization Operational Programme (COMPETE 2020)(grant numbers:UIDB/50008/2020,UIDP/50008/2020); MASSIVE5G(grant numbers:PTDC/EEI-TEL/30588/2017); Ph.D.(grant numbers:SFRH/BD/137745/2018); Swedish Research Council (VR); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9792258","Large intelligent surfaces (LIS);massive MIMO;beyond 5G systems;spacial resource allocation;dynamic resource allocation","Antennas;Baseband;5G mobile communication;Central Processing Unit;Transmitting antennas;Resource management;Computational complexity","5G mobile communication;computational complexity;MIMO communication;quality of service;telecommunication network planning","deployment strategies;large intelligent surfaces;beyond 5G communication systems;spectral power efficiencies;massive MIMO;computational complexity;system parameters;panel-based LIS;baseband outputs;square metre;activated area;panel size;terminal density;general panel sizes;moderate panel sizes;acceptable minimum terminal rate;higher implementation complexity;sparse static panel deployments;contiguous panel deployments;activated panels","","","","28","CCBY","9 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the millimeter-wave frequencies, the dosimetric quantity for human exposure to electromagnetic fields changes from the specific absorption rate to incident power density. In this paper, we used 28-GHz beam-steering patch arrays, a dipole antenna, and plane waves to investigate the temperature elevation in a multi-layer model of human head and its correlation with power density metrics. The power density averaged over one square-centimeter in free space and the peak temperature elevation in tissue at 28 GHz have good correlation.

However, coded targets in degraded images, such as images with motion blur effect, are hard to recognize. To this end, a set of novel Chinese character coded targets (CCTs) is designed and tested. A CCT is a square visual marker, shown as a relative small circular feature overlaid in the middle of a square Chinese character. A white circular ring is embedded in a black circle concentrically to serve as the circular feature, which facilitates extraction of the center point of the marker for localization. Whereas the distinctive peripheral Chinese character appearance of each CCT is utilized for identification. By synthesizing simulated CCTs with different degrees of motion blur and various postures with the real background images, a Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) is trained to locate and recognize the CCTs in motion blurred images. Experimental results on both artificial and actual motion blurred images demonstrate the superiorities of the designed CCTs as well as the proposed localization and recognition pipeline.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3006020","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51575276); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9129711","Chinese character coded targets (CCTs);coded target;faster R-CNN;motion blur;target recognition","Training;Decoding;Target recognition;Image recognition;Visualization;Three-dimensional displays;Feature extraction","character recognition;convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;image motion analysis;image recognition;image reconstruction;image restoration;image sensors;photogrammetry","Chinese character coded targets;feature point recognition;motion-blur effect;active visual feature points;close-range photogrammetry;robot navigation;degraded images;motion blur effect;CCT;square visual marker;circular feature;square Chinese character;white circular ring;center point;distinctive peripheral Chinese character appearance;background images;faster region-based convolutional neural network;artificial motion blurred images;actual motion blurred images;designed CCT;simulated CCT","","5","","21","CCBY","30 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nonetheless, there is still a clear need for affordable, portable and automated IoT-based solutions to expand the coverage of current cervical screening programs worldwide. This is particularly relevant for lower-resource countries, which account for 88% of all cervical cancer-related deaths. This work proposes a low-cost, smartphone-based microscopy device for the analysis of liquid-based cytology samples, through autonomous image acquisition and automated identification of cervical lesions. Different deep learning models for object detection were separately optimised and compared to select the most adequate network architecture. Transfer learning from a similar application domain - conventional cytology - was also investigated as a way of improving the robustness of the analysis pipeline, as well as overcoming the limitations of the mobile-acquired image dataset specifically collected and manually annotated by specialists under the scope of this work. In this process, a detection performance benchmark in the SIPAKMED dataset - test mean average precision (mAP) of 0.37798 and average recall (AR) of 0.63651 - was reported for the first time. Although further improvements are required for its integration in a computer-aided diagnosis system sufficiently reliable for deployment in a clinical context, the explored approach exhibits promising results (cross-validation mAP of 0.20315, AR of 0.46572 and analysis time of 4 minutes per cytological sample), corresponding to a step forward in the development of a cost-effective mobile IoT framework that supports cervical lesion screening.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3126486","project CLARE: Computer-Aided Cervical Cancer Screening(grant numbers:POCI-01-0145-FEDER-028857); European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) through Operational Programme for Competitiveness and Internationalisation (COMPETE 2020) and National Funds through the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT/MCTES); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9606873","Artificial intelligence;computer aided diagnosis;deep learning;Internet of Things;knowledge transfer;microscopy;object detection;telemedicine","Microscopy;Lesions;Cervical cancer;Feature extraction;Computer architecture;Pipelines;Microprocessors","biomedical optical imaging;cancer;deep learning (artificial intelligence);gynaecology;Internet of Things;medical image processing;object detection;optical microscopy;smart phones","autonomous image acquisition;deep learning models;mobile-acquired image dataset;cervical lesion screening;mobile detection;region-based approach;microscopic images;cervical cancer;automated IoT-based solutions;current cervical screening programs;smartphone-based microscopy device;liquid-based cytology samples;mobile IoT framework;computer-aided diagnosis system;time 4.0 min","","3","","47","CCBYNCND","8 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we first present a light field video dataset captured with a plenoptic camera. Then a new region-of-interest (ROI)-based video compression method is designed for light field videos. In order to further improve the compression performance, a novel view synthesis algorithm is presented to generate arbitrary viewpoints at the receiver. The experimental evaluation of four light field video sequences demonstrates that the proposed ROI-based compression method can save 5%-7% in bitrates in comparison to conventional light field video compression methods. Furthermore, the proposed view synthesis-based compression method not only can achieve a reduction of about 50% in bitrates against conventional compression methods, but the synthesized views can exhibit identical visual quality as their ground truth.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2907572","Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:L182032); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772436); China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201707000093); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8674797","Light field;video compression;region-of-interest;view synthesis;light field video dataset","Streaming media;Video sequences;Cameras;Correlation;Video coding;Light fields;Image coding","data compression;image sequences;video coding;video signal processing;video streaming","compression performance;view synthesis algorithm;light field video sequences;conventional light field video compression methods;region-of-interest compression;light field video streaming;scientific community;industries;light field video dataset;ROI","","16","1","26","OAPA","26 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this context, the development of systems for monitoring, forecasting, and controlling emissions plays an important role. The literature about forecasting systems based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) ensembles has been highlighted regarding statistical accuracy and efficiency. In this article, trainable and non-trainable combination methods are used for PM10 and PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 and 2.5 micrometers, respectively) time series forecasting for eight different locations, in Finland and Brazil, for different periods. Trainable ensembles based on ANNs, linear regression, and Copulas are compared with non-trainable combinations (mean and median), single ANNs, and linear statistical approaches.

Therefore, it is interesting and very attractive to propose a novel framework for multimodal biometric recognition based on Learning Distance Metric (LDM) via kernel SVM. This paper considers metric learning for SVM by investigating a hybrid Learning Distance Metric and Directed Acyclic Graph SVM (LDM-DAGSVM) model for multimodal biometric recognition, where LDM and DAGSVM are two emerging techniques in dealing with classification problems. Different from existing multimodal biometric recognition methods, the proposed approach aims to learn Mahalanobis distance metric via kernel SVM to maximize the inter-class variations and minimize the intra-class variations, simultaneously. Experimental results on the uncontrolled datasets such as AR face and AWE ear datasets show that the proposed approach achieves competitive performance compared with models working on individual modalities and overperforms the state-of-the-art multimodal methods.

Refined segmentation between the spine and cingulum detail regions is further realized. Later, effective feature extraction and description of global and local features were performed one by one by matching physiological features of algae with machine recognition features. Finally, the SVM model was applied for multi-class recognition. Results demonstrated that the proposed method can reduce imbalance rate of sample size and realize multi-class recognition of microscopic images of 15 categories of algae cells.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3007646","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972235,11801321,61771294); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9134439","Imbalanced classification;microscopic image recognition;multi-level features extraction","Algae;Feature extraction;Microscopy;Image segmentation;Image recognition;Shape","biology computing;feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;microorganisms;support vector machines","Kernel-ADASYN method;multidirectional projections;segmentation;spine region;feature extraction;machine recognition features;multiclass recognition;algae cells;microscopic image classification;image analysis;biological morphological differences;planktonic algae;physiological features;cingulum detail region;SVM model","","2","","30","CCBY","7 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is, perhaps, partly due to the ease of capturing images and videos on a mobile device and associating them with social and contextual metadata such as comments and GPS tags. Such a hybrid data structure can benefit a wide variety of potential (mobile) multimedia applications, such as location recognition, landmark search, augmented reality, and commercial recommendations. One intrinsic potential solution is to explore large-scale social multimedia to assist and facilitate location related applications on the go and in real-time. With the combination of social and mobile cues, several problems that are previously difficult to be tackled in multimedia content analysis have also become more tractable. Current research in Intelligent Sensing is addressing the following:","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2783138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8262685","","","","","","1","","","OAPA","17 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The requirement for computations at the edge are very stringent in terms of security, bandwidth, computational speed, latency and power consumption. These computations typically require signal processing algorithms running on resource-constrained mobile devices, while to provide the core services and the required computational power, cloud servers are applied. Leveraging services of cloud by mobile devices result in high latency and communication network and mobility-related issues, which can be mitigated by cleverly moving some of these computation to the edge. This special Section is exactly focused on addressing challenges raised by moving computation to the edge in a holistic way, by examining not only challenges related to algorithmic consideration and computational requirements but also circuits and systems and hardware platforms suitable for such implementation. The special Section also considers the trade-offs related to power and energy consumption, bandwidth versus computational complexity and security.","2644-1225","","10.1109/OJCAS.2021.3129544","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9645045","","Special issues and sections;Edge computing;Signal processing algorithms;Energy consumption;Power demand;Mobile handsets;Distributed databases","","","","","","0","CCBY","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
